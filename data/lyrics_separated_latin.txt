there 's a fire starting in my heart ,
reaching a fever pitch and it 's bringing me out the dark
finally , i can see you crystal clear .
go ahead and sell me out and i 'll lay your ship bare .
see how i leave , with every piece of you
do n't underestimate the things that i will do .
there 's a fire starting in my heart ,
reaching a fever pitch and it 's bringing me out the dark
the scars of your love , remind me of us .
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
the scars of your love , they leave me breathless
i ca n't help feeling ...
we could have had it all ... - i wish you , never had met me - ...
rolling in the deep - tears are gon na fall , rolling in the deep -
your had my heart ... - i wish you - ... inside of your hand - never had met me -
and you played it ... - tears are gon na fall - ... to the beat - rolling in the deep -
baby i have no story to be told ,
but i 've heard one of you and i 'm gon na make your head burn .
think of me in the depths of your despair .
making a home down there , as mine sure wo n't be shared .
the scars of your love , remind me of us .
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
the scars of your love , they leave me breathless
i ca n't help feeling ...
song over
i let it fall , my heart ,
and as it fell , you rose to claim it ,
it was dark and i was over ,
until you kissed my lips and you saved me ,
my hands , they 're strong ,
but my knees were far too weak ,
to stand in your arms
without falling to your feet ,
but there 's a side to you that i never knew , never knew ,
all the things you 'd say , they were never true , never true ,
and the games you 'd play , you would always win , always win ,
but i set fire to the rain ,
watched it pour as i touched your face ,
well , it burned while i cried ,
'cause i heard it screaming out your name , your name ,
when lay with you
i could stay there , close my eyes ,
feel you here forever ,
you and me together , nothing is better ,
but there 's a side to you that i never knew , never knew ,
all the things you 'd say , they were never true , never true ,
and the games you 'd play , you would always win , always win ,
but i set fire to the rain ,
watched it pour as i touched your face ,
well , it burned while i cried ,
'cause i heard it screaming out your name , your name ,
i set fire to the rain ,
and i threw us into the flames ,
well , i felt something die ,
'cause i knew that that was the last time , the last time ,
sometimes i wake up by the door ,
and heard you calling , must be waiting for you ,
even now when we 're already over ,
i ca n't help myself from looking for you ,
but i set fire to the rain ,
watched it pour as i touched your face ,
well , it burned while i cried ,
'cause i heard it screaming out your name , your name ,
i set fire to the rain ,
and i threw us into the flames ,
well , i felt something die ,
'cause i knew that that was the last time , the last time ,
song over
i heard that you 're settled down
that you found a girl
and you 're married now
i heard that your dreams came true
guess she gave you things
i did n't give to you
old friend why are you so shy
it ai n't like you to hold back
or hide from life
i hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but
i 'd hoped you 'd see my face
and that you 'd be reminded that for me it is n't over
never mind , i 'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
do n't forget me i beg i re-member you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead , yeah
you 'd know how time flies
only yesterday
was the time of our lives
we were born and raised
in a summer haze
bound by the surprise of our glory days
i hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but
i could n't stay away i could n't fight it
i 'd hoped you 'd see my face
and that you 'd be reminded that for me it is n't over
never mind , i 'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
do n't forget me i beg i re-member you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead , yeah
nothing compares no worries or cares
regrets and mistakes their memories make
who would have known how
bitter-sweet this would taste
never mind i ’ ll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
do n't forget me i beg i re-member you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
never mind i ’ ll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
do n't forget me i beg i re-member you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

to realize what we used to have , we do n't ,
there 's no religion that could save me
no matter how long my knees are on the floor , oh oh
so keep in mind all the sacrifices i 'm makin '
to keep you by my side to keep you from walking out the door

but they 're just afraid of something they ca n't understand , oooh

yo soy igual a ti
yo no te tengo miedo
pero es todo lo que tengo .
sin máscara yo voy desnuda
me sobran las dudas
pero estoy segura de mí
¿por qué me das guerra ?
¿por qué me echas tierra ?
si nadie se salva del fin .
aaabrázame que mi abrazo es un arma sin filo
y mi amor te hará bien
aaabrázame que estar cerca de mis enemigos
me hará fuerte a la vez .
déjame sólo ser
mi propia acuarela
ser libre para pintar
loooo que yo quiera
si en el mundo hay lugar suficiente
para tanta gente dime , tú , tú , tú
¿por qué me das guerra ?
¿por qué me echas tierra ?
si nadie se salva del fin .
aaabrázame que mi abrazo es un arma sin filo
y mi amor te hará bien
aaabrázame que estar cerca de tus enemigos
te hará fuerte a la vez .
sin máscara yo voy desnuda
me sobran las dudas
pero estoy segura de mi
¿por qué me das guerra ?
¿por qué me echas tierra ?
si nadie se salva del fin .
aaabrázame que mi abrazo es un arma sin filo
y mi amor te hará bien
aaabrázame que estar cerca de mis enemigos
me hará fuerte a la vez .
aaabrázame que mi abrazo es un arma sin filo
y mi amor te hará bien
aaabrázame que estar cerca de mis enemigos
me hará fuerte a la vez .
yo soy igual a ti , yo no te tengo miedo .
song over
i threw a wish in the well ,
do n't ask me , i 'll never tell
i looked to you as it fell ,
i trade my soul for a wish ,
pennies and dimes for a kiss
i was n't looking for this ,
your stare was holdin ' ,
ripped jeans , skin was showin '
hot night , wind was blowin '
where you think you 're going , baby ?
hey , i just met you ,
and this is crazy ,
but here 's my number ,
it 's hard to look right ,
at you baby ,
but here 's my number ,
hey , i just met you ,

but here 's my number ,
and all the other boys ,
try to chase me ,
but here 's my number ,
you took your time with the call ,
i took no time with the fall
you gave me nothing at all ,
i beg , and borrow and steal
have foresight and it 's real
i did n't know i would feel it , but it 's in my way
your stare was holdin ' ,
ripped jeans , skin was showin '

the smell of your skin lingers on me now
you 're probably on your flight back to your home town
i need some shelter of my own protection baby
to be with myself and center , clarity peace , serenity
i hope you know , i hope you know
that this has nothing to do with you
it 's personal , myself and i
we 've got some straightenin ' out to do
and i 'm gon na miss you like a child misses their blanket
but i 've got to get a move on with my life
it 's time to be a big girl now
and big girls do n't cry
do n't cry , don ’ t cry , don ’ t cry ...
the path that i 'm walking , i must go alone
i must take the baby steps 'til i 'm full grown , full grown
fairytales do n't always have a happy ending , do they ?
and i foresee the dark ahead if i stay
i hope you know , i hope you know
that this has nothing to do with you
it 's personal , myself and i
we 've got some straightenin ' out to do

we 'll play jacks and uno cards
i 'll be your best friend and you 'll be my valentine
yes you can hold my hand if you want to
'cause i want to hold yours too
we 'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds
but it 's time for me to go home
it 's getting late , dark outside
i need to be with myself and center , clarity peace , serenity

do you ever feel like a plastic bag ,
drifting through the wind
wanting to start again ?
do you ever feel , feel so paper thin
like a house of cards ,
one blow from caving in ?
do you ever feel already buried deep ?
6 feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
do you know that there 's still a chance for you
'cause there 's a spark in you
you just got ta ignite , the light , and let it shine
just own the night like the 4th of july
'cause baby you 're a firework
come on , show 'em what you 're worth
make 'em go `` oh , oh , oh ''
as you shoot across the sky-y-y
baby , you 're a firework
come on , let your colors burst
make 'em go `` oh , oh , oh ''

song over
this was never the way i planned ,
not my intention .
i got so brave , drink in hand ,
lost my discretion .
it 's not what i 'm used to ,
just want to try you on .
i 'm curious , for you ,
caught my attention .
i kissed a girl ,
and i liked it .
the taste of her cherry chapstick .
i kissed a girl ,
just to try it .
i hope my boyfriend do n't mind it .
it felt so wrong ,
it felt so right .
do n't mean i 'm in love tonight .
i kissed a girl ,
and i liked it .
i liked it
song over
summer after high school when we first met
we make out in you mustang to radio head
and on my 18th birthday we bought matching tattoos
used to steal your parent 's liquor and climb to the roof
talk about our future like we had a clue
never planned that one day i 'd be losing you
in another life i would be your girl
we keep all our promises be us against the world
in another life i would make you stay
so i do n't have to say you were the one that got away the one that got away
i was june you were my johnny cash
never one without the other we made a pact
sometimes when i miss you i put those records on woah
someone said you had your tattoo removed
saw you down town singin ’ the blues
it 's time to face the music i 'm no longer your muse
in another life i would be your girl
we keep all our promises be us against the world
in another life i would make you stay
so i do n't have to say you were the one that got away the one that got away
the one the one the one the one that got away
all his money ca n't buy me a time machine no
ca n't replace you with a million rings no
i shoulda told you what you meant to me woah
cause now i pay the price
in another life i would be your girl
we keep all our promises be us against the world
in another life i would make you stay
so i do n't have to say you were the one that got away the one that got away
the one the one the one
in another life i would make you stay
so i do n't have to say you were the one that got away e -- -- - strum once and let it ring - the one that got away

i 'm wide awake
i 'm wide awake
i 'm wide awake
yeah , i was in the dark
i was falling hard
with an open heart
i 'm wide awake
how did i read the stars so wrong
i 'm wide awake
and now it 's clear to me
that everything you see
ai n't always what it seems
i 'm wide awake
yeah , i was dreaming for so long
i wish i knew then
what i know now
would n't dive in
would n't bow down
gravity hurts
you made it so sweet
till i woke up on
on the concrete
falling from cloud 9
crashing from the high
i 'm letting go tonight
- yeah i 'm - falling from cloud 9
i 'm wide awake
not losing any sleep
i picked up every piece
and landed on my feet
i 'm wide awake
need nothing to complete myself - nooohooo
i 'm wide awake
yeah , i am born again
outta the lion 's den
i do n't have to pretend
and it 's too late
the story 's over now , the end
i wish i knew then
what i know now
would n't dive in
would n't bow down
gravity hurts
you made it so sweet
till i woke up on
on the concrete
falling from cloud 9
crashing from the high
i 'm letting go tonight - yeah , i 'm letting go -
i 'm falling from cloud 9
thunder rumbling
castles crumbling
i am trying to hold on
god knows that i tried
seeing the bright side
but i 'm not blind anymore ...
i 'm wide awake
i 'm wide awake
yeah , i 'm falling from cloud 9
crashing from the high
you know i 'm letting go tonight
i 'm falling from cloud 9

you know the bed feels warmer
sleeping here alone
you know i dream in colour
and do the things i want
you think you got the best of me
think you had the last laugh
bet you think that everything good is gone
think you left me broken down
think that i 'd come running back
baby you do n't know me , cause you 're dead wrong
what does n't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
does n't mean i 'm lonely when i 'm alone
what does n't kill you makes a fighter
footsteps even lighter
does n't mean i 'm over cause you 're gone
what does n't kill you makes you stronger , stronger
just me , myself and i
what does n't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
does n't mean i 'm lonely when i 'm alone
you heard that i was starting over with someone new
but told you i was moving on over you
you did n't think that i 'd come back
i 'd come back swinging
you tried to break me , but you see
what does n't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
does n't mean i 'm lonely when i 'm alone
what does n't kill you makes a fighter
footsteps even lighter
does n't mean i 'm over cause you 're gone
what does n't kill you makes you stronger , stronger
just me , myself and i
what does n't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
does n't mean i 'm lonely when i 'm alone
thanks to you i got a new thing started
thanks to you i 'm not a broken hearted
thanks to you i 'm finally thinking bout me
you know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
in the end ...
what does n't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
does n't mean i 'm lonely when i 'm alone
what does n't kill you makes a fighter
footsteps even lighter
does n't mean i 'm over cause you 're gone
what does n't kill you makes you stronger , stronger

closed off from love i didn ’ t need the pain
once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
time starts to pass before you know it you ’ re frozen
but something happened for the very first time with you
my heart melted to the ground found something true
and everyone ’ s looking round thinking i ’ m going crazy
but i don ’ t care what they say i ’ m in love with you
they try to pull me away but they don ’ t know the truth
my heart ’ s crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i
keep bleeding keep , keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding i keep , keep bleeding love
keep bleeding keep , keep bleeding love
you cut me open

stay with me i can make ,
make you glad you came
the sun goes down , the stars come out
and all that counts , is here and now
i 'm glad you came i 'm glad you came
the sun goes down , the stars come out
and all that counts , is here and now
i 'm glad you came , im glad you came
song over
