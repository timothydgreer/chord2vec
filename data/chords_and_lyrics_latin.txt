Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
Bb                                 Gm                Bb

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark


Ab                       Bb 
The scars of your love, remind me of us.
Gm                      Ab
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
Ab                       Bb
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
Gm              G7

Bb                                 Gm                   Bb 
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn.

Think of me in the depths of your despair.
Bb                         Gm                    Bb    
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.


Ab                       Bb 
The scars of your love, remind me of us.
Gm                      Ab

Ab                       Bb
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

Verse:
          Dm      F
I let it fall, my heart,
           C                    Bb
And as it fell, you rose to claim it,
        Dm            F
It was dark and I was over,
           C                     Bb
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me,
    Dm             F              
My hands, they're strong, 
          C                Bb
but my knees were far too weak,
     Dm           F
To stand in your arms 
          C               Bb
without falling to your feet,

Pre-Chorus:
               Bb                 Dm
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
          Bb                          Dm
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
         Bb                            C
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,

Chorus:
           Dm
But I set fire to the rain,
            C
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
           Bb
Well, it burned while I cried,
                                      Gm          C
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,

Verse:
      Dm       F
When lay with you
          C           Bb 
I could stay there, close my eyes, 
          Dm     F
feel you here forever,
        C                        Bb
You and me together, nothing is better,

Pre-Chorus:
               Bb                 Dm
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,

Well, it burned while I cried,
                                      Gm          C
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,
       Dm
I set fire to the rain,
            C
And I threw us into the flames,
         Bb
Well, I felt something die,
                                      Gm             C
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time,

Bridge:
          Dm                F
Sometimes I wake up by the door,
               C                        Bb
And heard you calling, must be waiting for you,
      Dm                     F
Even now when we're already over,
         C                        Bb
I can't help myself from looking for you,

Chorus:
           Dm
But I set fire to the rain,
            C
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
           Bb
Well, it burned while I cried,
                                      Gm          C
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,
       Dm
I set fire to the rain,

And I threw us into the flames,
         Bb
Well, I felt something die,

No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever can't hold me down

Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates,
Take a genius to understand me

Baby we start snagging, you come in part clothes
Girl i'm losing wing, my bucatti the same road
Show me your perfect pitch,
You got it my banjo
Talented with your lips, like you blew out candles
So amusing, now you can make a whistle with the music
Hope you ain't got no issue, you can do it
Give me the perfect picture, never lose it

                          Bbm                   Fm
Do you know that there's still a chance for you

Verse -same chords as first Verse-:

You don't have to feel like a waste of space 
You're original, cannot be replaced 
If you only knew what the future holds 
After a hurricane comes a rainbow 

Maybe your reason why all the doors are closed 
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road 
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow 
And when it's time, you'll know 

Pre-Chorus:
                Ab          Bbm          Fm     Db

- Same chords throughout the whole song -

No, I don't even know your name,
It doesn't matter.
Your my experimental game,
Just human nature.
It's not what good girls do,
Not how they should behave.
My head gets so confused,
Hard to erase.

I kissed a girl,
and I liked it.
The taste of her cherry chapstick.
I kissed a girl,
Just to try it.
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.

It felt so wrong,
It felt so right.
Don't mean i'm in love tonight.

I kissed a girl,
And I liked it.
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical,
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable,
Hard to resist, so touchable.
To good to deny it.
Ain't no big deal,
Its innocent.

I kissed a girl,
and I liked it.
The taste of her cherry chapstick.
I kissed a girl,
Just to try it.
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.

It felt so wrong,
It felt so right.
Don't mean i'm in love tonight.

I kissed a girl,
And I liked it.
I liked it

Saw you down town singin’ the blues

F
Closed off from love I didn’t need the pain
Dm
Once or twice was enough And it was all in vain
Bb                                                  C
Time starts to pass Before you know it you’re frozen


F
But something happened For the very first time with you
Dm  
My heart melted to the ground Found something true
Bb                                                    C
And everyone’s looking round Thinking I’m going crazy


F
But I don’t care what they say I’m in love with you
Dm
They try to pull me away But they don’t know the truth
Bb
My heart’s crippled by the vein That I keep on closing
C
You cut me open and I


F
Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love
Dm
I keep bleeding I keep, keep bleeding love
Bb
Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love
C
You cut me open


-same F  Dm  Bb  C chord pattern throughout the song-


Trying hard not to hear 
But they talk so loud 
Their piercing sounds fill my ears 
Try to fill me with doubt 
Yet I know that the goal 
Is to keep me from falling 

But nothing’s greater 
Than the rush that comes with your embrace 
And in this world of loneliness 
I see your face 
Yet everyone around me         
Thinks that I’m going crazy, maybe, maybe 

But I don’t care what they say
I’m in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don’t know the truth
My heart’s crippled by the vein 
That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I 

Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
You cut me open 

And it’s draining all of me 
Oh they find it hard to believe 
I’ll be wearing these scars 
For everyone to see 

I don’t care what they say 
I’m in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don’t know the truth 
My heart’s crippled by the vein 
That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love

When I walk on by, girls be looking like damn he fly
I pay to the beat, walking on the street in my new lafreak, yeah
This is how I roll, animal print, pants out control,
It's real fool with the big afro
They like bruce lee rock at the club

Girl look at that body - x3 -

Girl look at that body - x3 -

When I walk in the spot, this is what I see
Everybody stops and they staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it

I'm xxxx and I know it - x2 -

When I'm at the moss, purity just can't fight them off
When I'm at the beach, I'm in a speedo trying to tan my cheeks
This is how I roll, come on ladies it's time to go
We headed to the bar, baby don't be nervous
No shoes, no shirt, and I still get service

Girl look at that body - x3 -
