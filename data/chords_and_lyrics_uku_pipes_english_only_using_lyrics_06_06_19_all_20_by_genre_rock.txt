Dm   F
She, she ain't real,
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will,
She is a stranger,
You and I have history,
Or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all,
But, baby, is that really what you want?

Dm
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,
                   Gm
You made a fool out of you,

And, boy, she's bringing you down,
			Bb
She made your heart melt,
		Am
But you're cold to the core,
Gm
Now rumour has it she ain't got your love anymore,

Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,


She is half your age,
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed,
I heard you've been missing me,
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be,
Like when we creep out and she ain't around,
Haven't you heard the rumours?

Dm
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,
                   Gm
You made a fool out of me,

And, boy, you're bringing me down,
                      Bb                         Am
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core,
      Gm
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for,

Dm F
Rumour has it, ooh,

Verse:

I let it fall, my heart,
           C                    Bb
And as it fell, you rose to claim it,
        Dm            F
It was dark and I was over,

Until you kissed my lips and you saved me,
    Dm             F              
My hands, they're strong, 
          C                Bb

All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,

All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay?

Verse:
Bm

'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

I built a home and wait for someone to tear it down
Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running

I can't get the numbers, and play the guessing name

It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same

          G        
I was walking down the street,
               Bb
When out the corner of my eye
          C                   Bb      F
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me.
                G
She said "I've never seen a man
      Bb
Who looks so all alone,
            C          Bb    F
Could you use a little company?
        G
If you pay the right price
       Bb
Your evening will be nice,
            C                 Bb     F
And you can go and send me on my way."
                 G
I said "You're such a sweet young thing
        Bb           
Why you do this to yourself?"
      C               Bb                F     
She looked at me and this is what she said,

 G                                 Bb C F                     
"Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
 G                  Bb C F
Money don't grow on trees.
   G
I got bills to pay,
       Bb C F
I got mouths to feed,
             G                       Bb C F
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
         G
I know I can't slow down,
   Bb C F
I can't hold back,
            G                  Bb C F
Though you know, I wish I could.
          G                      Bb C F
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
         G                    Bb C F
Until we close our eyes for good".


Not even fifteen minutes later
I'm still walking down the street,
When I saw a shadow of a man creep out of sight.
Then he walks up from behind
And puts a gun up to my head,
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight.
He said "Give me all you've got
I want your money not your life,
But if you try to make a move I won't think twice."
I said "You can have my cash
But first you know I got to ask
What made you want to live this kind of life?"


He said "There ain't no rest for the wicked,
Money don't grow on trees.
I got bills to pay,
I got mouths to feed,
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
I know I can't slow down,
I can't hold back,
Though you know, I wish I could.
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
Until we close our eyes for good".


Now a couple hours passed
And I was sitting at my house,
The day was winding down and coming to an end.
So I turned on the TV
And flipped it over to the news,
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend.
I saw a preacher man in cuffs he'd taken money from the church,
He's got this bank account with righteous dollar bills.
But even still I can't say much
Because I know we're all the same,
Oh yes we've all got to satisfy those thrills.


"Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
Money don't grow on trees.
We got bills to pay,
We got mouths to feed,
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
I know we can't slow down,
We can't hold back,
Though you know, we wish we could.
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
Until we close our eyes for good"

Tears we cried a flood
G
Got all kinds of poison in
             Cadd9 D
Poison in my blood


G
I took my feet

To Oxford Street
                  Cadd9 D
Trying to right a wrong
G
Just walk away 

Those windows say
                          Cadd9 D
But I can't believe she's gone


Cadd9
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall

Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

To all those chandeliers of hope

Like some drunken Elvis singing

Saying how I always loved you darling

And I always will

Maybe they'll bring her back to me

I shut the world outside until the lights come on

I’d rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I’m in the black, maybe I’m on my knees
          A                      A
Maybe I’m in the gap batween the two trapezes

But my heart is beating and my pulses start

Cathedrals in my heart

To tell me it’s alright

When she was just a girl

She expected the world
        Gm                 F
But it flew away from her reach

So she ran away in her sleep

Every tear a waterfall

- Am  -     F        G
I used to rule the world 
           C                    Am
Seas would rise when I gave the word 
                     F     G
Now in the morning I sleep alone 
          C                 Am
Sweep the streets I used to own

F - G - C - Am    x2

- Am  -     F         G
I used to roll the dice 
          C                 Am
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
              F            G
Listen as the crowd would sing: 
          C                 Am
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"


- Am  -        F        G
One minute I held the key 
         C                    Am
Next the walls were closed on me 
                          F        G
And I discovered that my castles stand 
     C                    Am
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand 

  F              G
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
C             Am
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
F                G
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
   C                 Am
My missionaries in a foreign field 
F                 G
For some reason I can't explain 
C                     Am              F      G
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
         Bm               Am 
That was when I ruled the world 

F - G - C - Am    x2

- Am  -                 F     G
It was the wicked and wild wind 
              C               Am
Blew down the doors to let me in. 
                          F        G
Shattered windows and the sound of drums 
       C                    Am
People couldn't believe what I'd become

- Am  -    F      G
Revolutionaries wait 
        C               Am
For my head on a silver plate 
                   F      G
Just a puppet on a lonely string
   C                         Am
Oh who would ever want to be king? 


  F              G
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
C             Am
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
F                G
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
   C                 Am
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain 
  C                     Am              
I know Saint Peter will call my name ,
   F            G 
never an honest word

With resentment in their eyes

  Running back through the midmorning light

Verse:
Bm                        Gb7
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair  
A                     E7
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
G                         D
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light 
Em                                        Gb7
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night 

Bm                              Gb7
There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell 
A                                            E7
And I was thinking to myself, "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell" 
G                        D
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way 
Em                                  Gb7
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say...


Chorus:
G                        D 
Welcome to the Hotel California 
       Gb7                                Bm        Gb7  Bm
Such a lovely place - Such a lovely place - Such a lovely face 
G                               D
Plenty of room at the Hotel California  
    Em                                     Gb7
Any time of year - Any time of year - You can find it here


Verse:
Bm                           Gb7
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
A                                     E7
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends 
G                                D
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat. 
Em                      Gb7
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

Bm                           Gb7
So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine" 
          A                                     E7
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine" 
G                                       D
And still those voices are calling from far away, 
Em                                     Gb7
Wake you up in the middle of the night Just to hear them say...

What a nice surprise - what a nice surprise - Bring your alibis 


Verse:
Bm                      Gb7
Mirrors on the ceiling, The pink champagne on ice 
              A                               E7
And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device" 
G
And in the master's chambers, They gathered for the feast 
Em
They stab it with their steely knives, But they just can't kill the beast

Bm                           Gb7
Last thing I remember, I was Running for the door 
A                                 E7
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before 
G                                   D
"Relax, " said the night man, "We are programmed to receive. 
Em                                   Gb7
You can check-out any time you like, But you can never leave! "

I wanna be drunk when I wake up 
                  D        Em
On the right side of the wrong bed 

And every excuse I made up 

Tell you the truth I hate 
      C
What didn't kill me 
                          D   G
It never made me stronger at all. 



G
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me 
             D          Em
So now I'll maybe leave back there 
                                  C
I'm sat here wishing I was sober 
                                     D   G
I know I'll never hold you like I used to. 



         Em                       D
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating 
 G                             C
Without you to hold I'll be freezing 
Em                D
Can't rely on my heart to beat it 
G                                 C
'Cause you take part of it every evening 
Em                        D
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing 
G                                      C       G
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me. 


       D          C
Should I, should I?
         Em            G
Maybe I'll get drunk again 
       Em        G
I'll be drunk again 
       Em        G
I'll be drunk again 
                  C  D
To feel a little love 



I wanna hold your heart in both hands 
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can 
And I've got no plans for the weekend 
So shall we speak then 
Keep it between friends 
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to.


There maybe other people like us 
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up 
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before 
You don't hold me anymore. 


On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name 
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake 
You know I can't change as I began saying 
You cut me wide open like landscape 
Open bottles of beer but never champagne 
We'll applaud you with the sound that my hands make. 


Should I, should I? 
Maybe I'll get drunk again 
I'll be drunk again 
I'll be drunk again 
To feel a little love. 


Em         G
All by myself 

I'm here again 
Em         G
All by myself 

You know I'll never change 
Em         G
All by myself 
C       D   Em
All by myself 
         Em      G
I'm just drunk again 
         Em      G
I'll be drunk again 
         Em      G
I'll be drunk again

                          Bm                          G
And I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet.

Quite a difficult song when it comes to the strumming. Listen carefully to the song to understand the rhythm.

when things go wrong we can knock it down


G                    D    Em
My three words have two meanings,

    G                                            D           Em

                D
that's raging on


G                     D          Em
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
                                D
I'll pick you up when you're getting down

G                  D    Em
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
D            G
and colour you in
              D             Em                        G
if things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall


G                    D                Em
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
      D                   G
and I'll surrender up my heart
      D    Em    G
and swap it for yours


G                     D       Em
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love

Don't hold me down
             D                          C                D
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take

And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm

Dm             Gb        G7  
And though the moon is rising

Love can be frightening when you fall


Dm           A7              F                   G7 
And when the time is right I hope that you’ll respond

Like when the wind gets tired the ocean becomes calm

Let's be alone together
                 B
We could stay young forever

I don't know where I'm going but I don't think I'm coming home
Dbm           A            E             B
I said I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead

Verse 1:
 Em
 I got those jet pack blues
 C
 Just like Judy
                                       G
 The kind that makes June feel like September
                              D
 I’m the last one that you’ll ever remember
         Em
 And I’m trying to find that peace of mind
 C
 Behind these two white highway lines
          G
 When the city goes silent
                   D
 The ringing in my ears gets violent 

Pre-Chorus:
            Em         C      G
 She’s in a long black coat tonight
                Em         C       G
 Waiting for me in the downpour outside
                Em        C          G
 She’s singing “Baby come home” in a melody of tears
           Em            C          G
 While the rhythm of the rain keeps time 

Chorus:
                 C          D
 And I remember ”Baby, come home”
             Em         G

 I remember ”Baby, come home” 
              C                D
 Did you ever love her? Do you know?
                  Em          G
 Or did you never want to be alone?
                      C          D
 And she was singing “Baby, come home”
  Em         G
 "Baby, come home"

Verse 2:
 Em
 I’ve got those jet pack blues
 C                                              G
 Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me
                  D
 Honey, don’t you leave 
             Em
 Don’t you remember how we used to split a drink?
    C
 It never mattered what it was
                        G
 I think our hands were just that close
                     D
 The sweetness never lasted, no

Pre-Chorus:

 Waiting for me in the downpour outside
                Em        C          G
 She’s singing “Baby come home” in a melody of tears

 I remember ”Baby, come home”

Well, I see you standing there like a rabid dog
         Eb
And you got those crying eyes
F                Gm                         Eb
Makes me wanna surrender and wrap you in my arms

-same chord pattern-
You know I try to live without regrets
I'm always moving forward and not looking back
But I tend to leave a trail of death while I'm moving ahead
So I'm stepping away

Pre-Chorus:

Ahhhh....
'Cause I got nothing to say

Chorus:
F             Gm
Feels like, feels like it's coming

And when my fear pulls me out to sea
                    Eb
And the stars are hidden by my pride and my enemies
F                   Gm                    Eb
I seem to hurt the people that I care the most

-same chord pattern-
Just like an animal I protect my pride
When I'm too bruised to fight
And even when I'm wrong I tend to think I'm right
Well I'm bored at the game

Pre-Chorus:
Cm   Gm Dm
Ahhhh....
And too tired to rage

Chorus:
F             Gm
Feels like, feels like it's coming

It feels like, feels like I'm of coming of age
F                Gm
Feels like, feels like it's coming

Verse:
A                 E7    
Blacking in and out in a strange flat in East London
A                             D    
Somebody I don't really know just gave me something
    A                       E7                                  A    D    
To help settle me down and to stop me from always thinking about you


         A                               E7    
And you know you're life is heading in a questionable direction
            A                                  D    
When you're up for days with strangers and you can't remember anything
 A                                  E7                                   A    D          
Except the way you sounded when you told me you didn't know what I should do

Chorus:
E             E7               D                  E
     it's a long road up to recovery from here
   E7                   D    A   A
a long way back to the light
E             E7               D                  E
     it's a long road up to recovery from here
   E7                   D    A   A  
a long way to making it right

Verse:
          A                            E7    
And so I wake up in the morning just like every other day
               A                             D    
And just like every boring blues song I get swallowed by the pain
       A                           E7                          A  D    
So I fumble for your figure in the darkness just to make it go away


                A                         E7    
But you're not lying there any longer and I know that that's my fault
           A                                 D    
So I've been pounding on the floor and I've been crawling up the walls
                  A                        E7      
And I've been dipping in my darkness for serotonin 
              A                      D    
boosters, cider and some kind of smelling salts

Chorus:
E             E7               D                  E
     it's a long road up to recovery from here
   E7                   D    A   A  
a long way back to the light
E             E7               D                  E
     it's a long road up to recovery from here

So on the first night we met, you said well darling let's make a deal
   Gbm                    D                                         A   
If anybody ever asks us, let's just tell them that we met in jail


                Gbm                             D    
And that's the story that I'm sticking to like a southern facing compass
       A                                   E    
But tonight I need to hear some truth if I'm ever getting through this
           Gbm                              D    
Yeah, you once sent me a letter that said if you're lost at sea
         A                                 E    
Close your eyes and catch the tide my dear and only think of me
        G                                  D    
Well, darling now I'm was sinking I'm as lost as lost can be
           E                           E7                           A
And I was hoping you could drag me up from down here towards my recovery

Interlude: E7  A  D        

Verse:
              A                         E7    
If you could just give me a sign, just a subtle little glimmer
       A                                      D    
Some suggestion that you'd have me if I could only make me better
              A                            E7                          A      D    
Then I would stand a little stronger as I walk a little taller all the time


           A                       E7    
Because I know you are a cynic but I think I can convince you
             A                            D    
Yeah, cause broken people can get better if they really want to
       A                           E7                       A      D    
Or at least that's what I have to tell myself if I am hoping to survive

Chorus:
E             E7               D                  E
     it's a long road up to recovery from here
   E7                   D    A   A  
a long way back to the light
E             E7               D                  E

Some people offered up answers
We made out like we heard
They were only words
They didn't add up
To a change in the way we were living
And the saddest thing
Is all of it could have been avoided

But it was like to stop consuming's
to stop being human
And why'd I make a change if you won't?
We're all in the same boat
Staying afloat for the moment

   C                       Dm                Bb
We walk the plank with our eyes wide open we

Her eyes and words are so icy
           Bbm
Oh but she burns
     Gb          Db
Like rum on the fire
Db                Db
Hot and fast and angry
   Db
As she can be
Bbm        Gb         Db
I walk my days on a wire.

Pre-Chorus:

  It looks ugly, but it's clean,
Gb    Bbm           Ebm         Db
  Oh momma, don't fuss over me.

Chorus:
            Gb            Bbm              Db
The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
     Gb              Bbm            Db
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
    Gb                 Ebm                   Db
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine.

Verse:
Db               Db
Calls of guilty fall on me
Db             Bbm
All while she stains
    Gb              Db
The sheets of some other
Db               Db
Thrown at me so powerfully
Db             Bbm              Gb          Db
Just like she throws with the arm of her brother.

Pre-Chorus:

  But I want it, it's a crime
Gb            Bbm         Ebm          Db
  That she's not around most of the time.

Chorus:

The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine

In the tide of her breathing.

Pre-Chorus:

Gb     Bbm          Ebm          Db

Verse:
G           C
I had a thought dear
          Em
However scary
             C
About that night
                   G
The bugs and the dirt.
              C
Why were you digging?
              Em
What did you bury
               C
Before those hands pulled me 
           G
from the earth?

Chorus:
G            C
I will not ask you where you came from
G           Em
I will not ask and neither should you
G           C                        Em
Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
               C                       G
We should just kiss like real people do

Verse:
G             C
I knew that look dear
               Em
Eyes always seeking
                C
Was there in someone
                G
That dug long ago
               C
So I will not ask you
               Em
Why you were creeping
             C              G
In some sad way I already know

Chorus:
G             C
So I will not ask you where you came from
G           Em
I will not ask and neither should you
G           C                        Em
Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips

There's an art to life's distractions
      Em            D                   Bm         C
Somehow escapes the burning weight the art of scraping through
G         Bm   C      D
Some like to imagine
      Em            D              Bm         C
The dark thrills of someone else I guess any thrill will do

Verse -same as first-:
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
To drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

           E                                         B
Back when all my little goals seemed so important
  E                                  B
Every pot of gold fill and full of distortion
 E                                   B                          
Heaven was a place still in space not in motion


              Gb
But soon
          E
I got you
         B
I got everything
              E
I’ve got you
              B
I don’t need nothing
                  E
More than you
         B
I got everything
               Gb
I’ve got you


              E
We went walking through the hills
              B
Tryin’ to pretend that we both know
 E
Maybe if we save up
             B
We can build a little home
       E
But then the hell storm came and yelled, 
  B                                               Gb
“You need to let go, you’ve got no control. No.”


          E
I got you
         B
I got everything
             E
I’ve got you
            B
I don’t need nothing
                 E
More than you
         B
I got everything
            Gb
I’ve got you


           B                     Abm
This weight’s too much alone
          B                          Abm
Some days I can't hold it at all
       B                Abm
You take it on for me
           Gb
When tomorrow’s too much
      E
I’ll carry it all
             B
I’ve got you


        E                      Gb
And when tomorrow’s too much
     E
I’ll carry it all
         B
I got you

I got you
         B
I got everything
             E
I’ve got you

I don’t need nothing

      Dm         Dm7      B        Gm7    Dm
Is to save every day till eternity passes away
        Gm              A7
Just to spend them with you.

Verse:
   Dm           Dm        Dm7    Dm6
If I could make days last forever
    Gm6                          A7
If words could make wishes come true
      Dm         Dm7      B        Gm7    Dm
I'd save every day like a treasure and then
        Gm              A7
Again, I would spend them with you.

Chorus:
          D              Dmaj7
But there never seems to be enough time
   D6                D                   G       Gmaj7 Em7 A7
To do the things you want to do Once you find them
     D             Dmaj7
I've looked around enough to know
     D6               D                  G         Gmaj7 Em7 A7
That you're the one I want to go through time with.

Verse:

If I had a box just for wishes
    Gm6                        A7
And dreams that had never come true
    Dm           Dm7   B              Gm7    Dm
The box would be empty except for the memory
       Gm              7
Of how they were answered by you

Chorus:
          D              Dmaj7
But there never seems to be enough time

Verse:
     C                 Am
I've heard there was a secret chord
     C                    Am
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
    F                G               C       G
But you don't really care for music, do you?

Pre-Chorus:
   C                   F           G
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
    Am              F
The minor fall, the major lift
    G               Em          Am
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Chorus:
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Verse:
     C                        Am
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
    C               Am
You saw her bathing on the roof
    F             G             C        G
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you

Pre-Chorus:
    C 
She tied you
     F       G
To a kitchen chair
    Am     
She broke your throne,
    F
she cut your hair
    G                  Em            Am
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Chorus:

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Verse:
C               Am
Maybe I've been here before
  C                    Am
I know this room, I've walked this floor
  F             G             C       G
I used to live alone before I knew you

Pre-Chorus:
     C                     F      G
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Am             F
love is not a victory march
       G               Em          Am
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Chorus:
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F          C-G-C-C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Verse:
      C                Am
There was a time you'd let me know
C                     Am
What's real and going on below
    F             G             C       G
But now you never show it to me do you?

Pre-Chorus:
   C            F        G
Remember when I moved in you?
    Am            F
The holy dark was moving too
    G               Em            Am
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Chorus:
     F           Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
      F          C-G-C-C
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Verse:
C               Am
Maybe there's a God above
    C          Am
And all I ever learned from love
    F               G              C        G
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you

Pre-Chorus:
     C                 F       G
It's not a cry you can hear at night
     Am                 F
It's not somebody who's seen the light
       G               Em          Am
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Verse 1:
Em
      Memories consume

Like opening the wound

I'm picking me apart again

You all assume

I'm safe here in my room

Unless I try to start again

Pre-Chorus:
C               Am
I don't want to be the one
    C              Em 
The battles always choose
       C        Am
'Cause inside I realize
     C              Em
That I'm the one confused

Chorus:
  Em                      C
I don't know what's worth fighting for
   B    
Or why I have to scream.
  Em               C
I don't know why I instigate
    B
And say what I don't mean.
  Em               C
I don't know how I got this way
  B
I know it's not alright.
       C            D

Verse 2:
Em        D         Em
       Clutching my cure

I tightly lock the door
  D               Em
I try to catch my breath again
  D         Em
I hurt much more
     
Than any time before
  D              Em
I had no options left again

Pre-Chorus:
C               Am
I don't want to be the one
    C              Em 
The battles always choose
       C        Am
'Cause inside I realize
     C              Em
That I'm the one confused

Chorus:

I don't know what's worth fighting for

Or why I have to scream.
  Em               C
I don't know why I instigate

      I'll never fight again
G                        Am
      And this is how it ends

Chorus:
  Em                      C
I don't know what's worth fighting for
   B    
Or why I have to scream.
    Em              C
But now I have some clarity
   B
To show you what I mean.
  Em               C
I don't know how I got this way
  B
I know it's not alright.

I dreamed I was missing
              C    
You were so scared

But no one would listen 
                    Dm
‘Cause no one else cares 
         Am
After my dreaming
                 C 
I woke with this fear

What am I leaving?

When I'm done here

Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Pre-Chorus:
- Caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone -

Every step I take is another mistake to you

Chorus:

I've become so tired so much more aware
		     D		 A
I've becoming this all I want to do
		 E		     Gbm
Is be more like me and be less like you

Verse 2:
			       D
Can't you see that you're smothering me
    A		       E	      Gbm
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
			     D
Cause everything that you thought I would be

Has fallen apart right in front of you

And every second I waste is more than I can take

I've become so numb I can't feel you there
		 E		    Gbm

This is not the end, this is not the beginning, 
        Amaj7
Just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision 
         E 
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm 
           Amaj7 
Though the words sound steady something empty's within 'em 

      
We say Yeah! With fists flying up in the air 
Like we're holding onto something That's invisible there, 
'Cause we're living at the mercy of The pain and the fear 
Until we dead it, Forget it, Let it all disappear. 


E
Waiting for the end to come 
               Amaj7
Wishing I had strength to stand 
                 E
This is not what I had planned 
                  Amaj7  B
It's out of my controoooool.... 


Flying at the speed of light 
Thoughts were spinning in my head 
So many things were left unsaid 
It's hard to let you go... 



Dbm                           A
- Oh! - I know what it takes to move on, 
Dbm                    A
I know how it feels to lie, 
E
All I wanna do 
    B                                  
Is trade this life for something new 
Dbm                          B    E 
Holding on to what I haven't gooooot 



E
Sitting in an empty room 
             A
Trying to forget the past
                E    
This was never meant to last, 
                Asus2        
I wish it wasn't so... 



- Oh! - I know what it takes to move on, 
I know how it feels to lie, 
All I wanna do 
Is trade this life for something new 
Holding on to what I haven't got 



What was left when that fire was gone? 
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong 
All caught up in the eye of the storm 
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on 
And i don't even know what kind of things I've said 
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead 
So, picking up the pieces, now where to begin? 
The hardest part of ending Is starting again!! 



Interlude: E - E - Dbm - B



All I wanna do 
Is trade this life for something new 
Holding on to what i haven't got...

This is not the end 
This is not the beginning,

Just a voice like a riot 
Rocking every revision

- Holding on to what i haven't got - 
But you listen to the tone 
And the violet rhythm 
Though the words sound steady 
Something empty's within 'em 


We say Yeah! 
With fists flying up in the air 
Like we're holding onto something 
That's invisible there, 
 Dbm                         B

          Bm     G            A
I can't talk to you or your friends
          Bm
It's not only you,
     G            A             Bm
My heart jumps around when I'm eluded to
              G     A
This will not do 
             Bm          G      A 
Cause I was raised up to be admired,
        Bm  
to be noticed
      G               A
But when you're withdrawn,
          Bm
it's the closest thing  
       G           A          Bm
to assault when all eyes are on you
              G    A
This will not do

Interlude -x4-: Bm  Bm  G  A

             Bm
I'm faking glory
         G             A
Lick my lips toss my hair
            Bm
And send a smile over
         G           A
And the story brand new
       Bm
I can take it from here,
      G        A       Bm    G   A
I'll find my own bravado

Chorus -x2-:
D               
It's a switch flipped

It's a pill tipped back
                 Em
It's a moon eclipsed, oh
Bm                                                              A
And I can tell that, when the lights come on I'll be ready for this
D
It's in your bloodstream
                                   Em
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
Bm                                                      A
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size
D
I was frightened of every little thing
                   Em     Bm
that I thought was out to get me down
                            A
To trip me up, and laugh at me,
    D
But I learned not to hold the quiet of the room
               Em       Bm
And the one around to find me out
                                                              
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go, oh

Verse:

There's a humming in the restless summer air
           Cm                                 Eb
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
           Ab                 Fm
But in all chaos, there is calculation
    Cm                               Eb
Dropping glasses just to hear them break
               Ab                              Fm
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end -it didn't-
        Cm                                 Eb
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend -go figure-
        Ab                      Fm
It's clear that someone's gotta go
     Cm                                Eb
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean

Pre-Chorus:
         Ab                  Fm     Cm   
And the cry goes out
      Eb                         
They lose their minds for us
        Ab                  Fm    
And how it plays out 
  Cm
Now we're in the ring
             Eb
And we're coming for blood

Chorus:
Ab
You could try and take us
Fm
But we're the gladiators
Ab
Everyone a rager

Delicate in every way but one -the swordplay-

God knows we like archaic kinds of fun -the old way-

Chance is the only game I play with, baby

      Ab                     Fm                    Cm
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home

Tired little laughs, gold lie promises, we'll always win at this

I don't ever think about death

It's alright if you do, it's fine

We gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Ab                              Fm                       Cm
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
Ab                   Fm                  Cm
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain, "Secretly you love this

Do you even wanna go free?"

Wait 'til you're announced

We've not yet lost all our graces

The hounds will stay in chains

Look upon your greatness

That you’ll send

The call I'll send

   Call all the ladies out

Verse:
G                         Am                     F
Don't you think that it's boring how people talk
G                         Am                     F
Making smart with their words again, well I'm bored
                 G                             
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Am                                          F
Never not chasing a million things I want
            G
And I am only as young as the minute is full of it
Am                                                   F
Getting pumped up from the little bright things I bought

But I know they'll never own me
-Yeah-

Chorus:

Baby be the class clown
C                            Am
I'll be the beauty queen in tears

It's a new art form showing people how little we care -yeah-
F                 C                               G
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
                                     Am
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah -yeah-

Verse -same as first-:
Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's filling up with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I xxxx with the fun again, when I'm known
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
Everything's cool when we're all in line, for the throne
But I know it's not forever
-Yeah-

Chorus:
G
Baby be the class clown
C                            Am
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
                                G
It's a new art form showing people how little we care -yeah-
F                 C                               G
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
                                     Am
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah -yeah-

Bridge -same chord pattern-:
It looked alright in the pictures -yeah-
Getting caught soft with the triple is it
I fall apart, with all my heart
And you can watch from your window
-laughs-
And you can watch from your window

Chorus:
G
Baby be the class clown
C                            Am

I'm in a clique but I want out
                                 C
It's not the same as when I was punched

In the old days there was enough
                                                 F
The card games and ease with the bitter song of blood

I was in but I want out
                            C
My mother's love is choking me

I'm sick of words that hang above my head
                                           F
What about the kid? It's time the kid got free

We are proud of the love club

Everything will glow for you

I joined the club and it's all on
                                     C
There are fights for being my best friend

And the girls get the claws out
                                                F
There's something about hanging out the wicked kids

Take the pill make it too ill
                                 C
The other day I forgot my old address

I'm sitting pretty on the throne, there's nothing more I want
                   F
Except to be alone.

Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go

So drop your chin and take yourself back home

And roll out your maps and papers

Find out your hiding places again

The only problem that I got with the club
                                                          F

When you're a member go on your great adventure again

N' we'll be waiting at the end

To use inside your home

Forgot the batteries

But that's the old me

Shouting out of my windows

Rolled down

Of a parking lot

All these words

I don't need em now

Shouting out of my windows
Gbm    E
Rolled down

There's a ghost in my bedroom, it haunts me at night
       Am           G            F  
I've asked him to leave, but he keeps stopping by
 Dm                          G
Just when I think that I'm alone
     C        E             F  
It shows up again with a friend this time
         Dm              G
And now this is getting old
                     Am
I don't know what to do
F           G                  C
Metaphorically, this ghost is you.


           C                      E
Now this ghost in my bedroom he gives me advice
     Am          G             F             
He promised one day that he'd teach me to fight 
F                           G
Now when I think that I'm alone
    C        E
He comes up my way with a devil smile 
         F              G
Singing this is now my home 
                 C
You're my wish come true 
          F                  E             G         C
When you reach that golden cloud I'll be there with you


                 F                C
If there were monsters in the closet 
               E                    Am
Well I don't think I would be surprised
             F                  C
I hear them call out from my window
               E                 G
They try and trick me to come outside

 I won't let you down-
     G         C
We talked all day
              E                F                       C
I can't tell if he's real or a made up version of her again 
  G     C                      E
Never alone, because I've got you
                    Am
Get this out of my head


             G           F  
No I won't waste away my love
                 C
On to something new
            F            E
If there's only one way out
      G             C
I'll come back for you


          F                C
If I get stuck out there forever
        E                   Am
Tell everyone that I said goodbye
               F               C
You're on my lifelong list of wishes
             E
If I could bring you back 
F                     C
We don't belong here now
                             E                      Am          
If he stays well that just means I've got numbered days
          F                  Am
Til I go back to my little world
                E                     C
Where it's just me and my imaginary friends


C
So go out and love
        Am
Find a new direction

 Here's my heart, keep it for protection
            E            Am
Don't get stuck on your way
           F              C
The other side's a scary place
                        Am
Do your best not to be afraid
                         Am
Lose it all when we run away
                           F  
Letting go of the little things you know I do
            C
There's a ghost in my bedroom
           E
 And he's dying to meet you
                 Am
God knows he's heard all about you
               F  
I guess he's friendly enough
                      C
Though I've seen him lie
              Am            
He's seeking roses in your bed
                       F  
Says he won't let you down

He will! He will! He will!


           C                    Am F  
There's a ghost in my bedroom

 He will! He will! He will! 

Will the crowd go crashing down?


                              Am
Slowly slowly how could I go down
                 F  
I want you to notice when I let go


C                             Am
Slowly slowly how could I go down?

I want you to notice when I let go

              G                 Em
Some people watch, some people pray
           G              C
But even lights can fade away
             G                 Em
Some people hope, some people pay
     C              G    C
But why we have to stay


            G                     Em
Cause even here, we're scared to bruise
         G          C
Or any misery you choose
              G               Em
You like to watch, we like to use
    C                G     C
And we were born to lose


          Am             D
I choose defeat, I walk away

Some like to sleep, we like to play

Just look at all that pain


               G              Em
You want the heart and to be saved
          G                   C
But even good guys still get paid
               G                  Em
So watch your back and keep the blade
                     G    C
I think it got you laid


               G                  Em
So fake your death, oh it's your blame
                G                 C
And leave the lights on when you stay
                G                    Em
Take off your clothes and dream and fade
                        G     C
Come on and feel that shame


           Am            D
I choose defeat, I walk away
                 G             Em
And leave this place for sane today

Just look at all that pain

Just look at all that pain

Just look at all that pain

Just look at all that pain

Just give me all that pain

Just give me all that pain

Intro: C

Verse:
          C
Lost in skies of powdered gold
           Fmaj7
Caught in clouds of silver ropes
         C 
Showered by the empty hopes
     Fmaj7
As I tumble down falling fast to the ground

Pre-Chorus:
   Am             G
I know I'll wither
                 Fmaj7
So peel away the bark

Because nothing
                  Am
Grows when it is dark
                    G
In spite of all my fears
                     Fmaj7
I can see it all so clear

I see it all so clear

Chorus:
   C
Wohoo
            G       Am
Cover your crystal eyes
              G                 Fmaj7       C
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
   C
Wohoo
            G       Am
Cover your crystal eyes
             G                 Fmaj7       C
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine

Verse:
        C
Making ways in pitch black sand
         Fmaj7
Feel the salt dance on my hands
         C
Raw and charcoal coloured thighs
        Fmaj7
Feel so cold and my skin feels so paper-thin

Pre-Chorus:
-G-  Am             G
 I know I'll wither
                 Fmaj7
So peel away the bark

Because nothing
                  Am
Grows when it is dark
                    G
In spite of all my fears
                     Fmaj7
I can see it all so clear

I see it all so clear

Chorus:
   C
Wohoo
            G       Am
Cover your crystal eyes
              G                 Fmaj7       C
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
   C
Wohoo
            G       Am
Cover your crystal eyes
             G                 Fmaj7       C
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine

Bridge:
        Am                 G
But I'm OK in see-through skin
      Fmaj7   
I forgive what is within
                     Am                 G
Because I'm in this house, I'm in this home
      Fmaj7
All my time

Chorus:
   C
Wohoo
            G       Am
Cover your crystal eyes
              G                 Fmaj7       C
And feel the tones that tremble down your spine
   C
Wohoo
            G       Am
Cover your crystal eyes
             G                 Fmaj7       C
And let your colours bleed and blend with mine

The sky wasn't be enough for them all

Took down the queen bee and her men

Tell her that I miss our little talks

Soon it will be over and buried with our past

We used to play outside when we were young - and full of life and full of love -

For all the joy that is to come 
                        A
For all the things that you're alive to feel
                    B
Just let the pain remind you hearts can heal
                A
How were you to know? 
                B
How were you to know?

Chorus:

I would not take it for granted -granted-

  At least they would remind me 

Not to make the

Recount the night that I first

Met your mother

You felt the weight of the world

Fall off your shoulder

We sang along to the start of forever

Same chord progression throughout almost the whole song: Am Em Em Am

Verse 1
Am                Em
Dig if u will the picture
   Em                   Am
Of u and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can u my darling
Can u picture this?


VRESE 2 -Am  Em  Em  Am-
Dream if u can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you


Chorus -Am  Em  Em  Am-
How can u just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just 2 demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father 2 bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied 
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like when doves cry


Interlude  F    F G     F F F G 


VRESE 3 -Am  Em  Em  Am-
Touch if u will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you 
Even doves have pride


Chorus x2 -Am  Em  Em  Am-
How can u just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just 2 demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father 2 bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied 
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like when doves cry

Intro: Am Em F

Verse:
 Am                    Em   F   **
Bury all your secrets in my skin
 Am                        Em  F  
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
 Am                         Em       F
The air around me still feels like a cage
 Am                           Em   F       
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again… 

Pre Chorus: Am Em F

Chorus:
                        G                       Am
So if you love me, let me go. And run away before I know.
                             G                               Am
My heart is just too dark to care. I can't destroy what isn't there.
                    G                            Am
Deliver me into my Fate - If I'm alone I cannot hate
                       G
I don't deserve to have you…
    F                                                     Am
My smile was taken long ago / If I can change I hope I never know

Pre Verse: Am Em F 

Verse:
    Am                   Em      F    
I still press your letters to my lips
     Am                        Em     F
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
   Am                         Em    F
I couldn't face a life without your light
    Am                            Em   F       
But all of that was ripped apart… when you refused to fight

Chorus:
                                G                              Am 
So save your breath, I will not hear. I think I made it very clear.
                          G                                 Am
You couldn't hate enough to love. Is that supposed to be enough?
                            G                                   Am
I only wish you weren't my friend. Then I could hurt you in the end.
                          G
I never claimed to be a Saint…
    F                                                            Am
My own was banished long ago / It took the Death of Hope to let you go

You Never Needed Any Help

You Sold Me Out To Save Yourself

Hey boy, stop pacing around the room
        F              C          G         Am
Using other people's faces as a mirror for you
              F          C 
I know your lungs need filling
          G                        Am 
Since your gums have lost their feeling

From being just -  and giving it up

Eb 
And it starts sometime around midnight                   
       Cm                            Ab                    Eb 
Or at least that’s when you lose yourself for a minute or two
Eb 
As you stand under the bar lights
           Cm                             Ab                     Eb 
While the band plays some song, about forgetting yourself for a while
          Cm                         Ab              Eb 
And the piano's this melancholy soundtrack for her smile
      Cm            - break -           Ab                            
That white dress she's wearing, you haven’t seen her for a while


Eb 
But you know, that she’s watching
        Cm                             Ab                       Eb 
She’s laughing, she’s turning. She’s holding her tonic like a cross
     Cm                               Ab                        Eb 
The room's suddenly spinning, as she walks up and asks how you are
            Cm                         Ab                         Eb 
So you can smell her perfume, you can see her lying naked in your arms


Eb 
And so there’s a change in your emotions
               Cm                      Ab                      Eb 
When all these memories come rushing, like feral waves to your mind
          Cm                      Ab                     Eb 
Of curl of your bodies, like two perfect circles entwined
             Cm                         Ab                      Eb 
So you feel hopeless and homeless, and lost in the haze of the wine


Eb 
Then she leaves with some one you don't know
        Cm                           Ab                       Eb 
But she makes sure you saw her, she looks right at you and bolts
        Cm                             Ab                        Eb 
As she walks out the door, your blood boiling, your stomach in ropes
       Cm               - break -                Ab           
Oh and when your friends say, "what is it you look like you’ve seen a ghost"


Bridge: Eb ... Ab Bb Cm ... Ab Bb Eb - or Ab Bb - x3 - Bbsus2 -


Eb 
Then you walk under the streetlights                 
           Cm                         Ab                     Eb 
And you’re too drunk to notice, that everyone is staring at you
                Cm                          Ab                      Eb 
You just don’t care what you look like, the world is falling around you


Cm
you just have to see her
Ab
you just have to see her
Cm 
you just have to see her
Ab
you just have to see her
Cm
you just have to see her

you know that she'll break you in two....

They call the Risin' Sun

Is a suitcase and a trunk
        Am   C         D          F
And the only time that he's satis-fied
   Am        E    Am

Verse: 
C                  Em        Am
When my body won't hold me anymore 
F              Em
And it finally lets me free 
F         G
Will I be ready? 
C                  Em           Am
When my feet won't walk another mile 
F                           Em
And my lips give their last kiss goodbye 
F                G
Will my hands be steady?

Chorus: 
       F
When I lay down my fears 
   G
My hopes and my doubts 
    F
The rings on my fingers
        G 
And the keys to my house
    Am  Em    F         G 
With no hard feelings

Verse: 
C                  Em         Am
When the sun hangs low in the west 
F                         Em
And the light in my chest won't be kept 
F               G
Held at bay any longer 
C                 Em    Am
When the jealousy fades away
F                     Em
And it's ash and dust for cash and lust 
F             G
And it's just hallelujah 

Chorus: 
    F
And love in thoughts 
    G
And love in the words

Love in the songs

G       C          F
Kept me afraid and cold

With so much to have and hold

Verse: 
C                  Em      Am
When my body won't hold me anymore

And it finally lets me free 
F            G
Where will I go? 
C                    Em      Am
Will the trade winds take me south 
F                        Em
Through Georgia grain or tropical rain 
F                G
Or snow from the heavens?


C                    Em    Am
Will I join with the ocean blue
F               Em 
Or run into the savior true 
F               G
And shake hands laughing 

Chorus:

And walk through the night

Straight to the light

Holding the love

I've known in my life

Under the curving sky

I'm finally learning why

It matters for me and you 
G             C       F
To say it and mean it too

For life and its loveliness 
G              C   F
And all of its ugliness 
G           C       F
Good as its been to me

            Fm                       Bbm
We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
           Gb
Hold each other 'till the morning light
    Db                     Bbm
We used to laugh, now we only fight
 Ab                    Gb
Baby are you lonesome now?

Verse:

At night I come home after they go to sleep
         Gb         Db       Ab               
Like a stumbling ghost I haunt this hall
            Db        Ab           Gb
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
        Gb        Db          Ab                     Gb
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls

Chorus:
          Ab          Gb
We can't wait 'till tomorrow
           Ab                Bbm
No we're caught up in the appeal
       Gb
Baby, why you wanna hide it?
          Bbm        Db      Gb
It's the last thing on my mind - Why you wanna hide it? -
   Ab
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive 

Bridge:

Ain't we all just runaways?
                 Gb
I knew it when I met you
Db              Ab       Db  Ab   Gb
I'm not gonna let you runaway

I knew it when I held you

I wasn't letting go

Verse:

When you left this town, with your windows down
        E
And the wilderness inside

Let the exits pass, all the tar and glass
         E
'Til the road and sky align

But you held your course to some distant war

In the corners of your mind

Verse:
Diamonds cut, diamonds cut for the carrots
Plaster of paris, the floats fill up the street

And the beauty queens, beauty queens with the white gloves
All sick from the night clubs, they wave with pageantry, pageantry

Chorus:
Oh my my oh hey hey
Here it comes, the big parade
Marching bands and barricades
Make way, for the big parade

Verse:
Canvas covered, canvas covered in resin
The violent men who dance the blood ballet
And the bookies say, bookies say it's the 3rd round
Oh when louie will go down, if he don't there's hell to pay, and hell to raise

Chorus:
And oh my my oh hey hey
Here he comes, the welterweight
Take a dive, for goodness sake
Or say goodbye to the welterweight

Verse:
Catholic priest, catholic priest in a crisis
He's torn between romance and jesus, who will win the civil war

And he says I'm in love, I'm in love with a woman
Yea this is my confession, I'm leaving I can't a priest anymore, anymore

Chorus:
And oh my my oh hey hey
There he goes, the man of faith

Left the church for a fiance
Let him love, the man of faith


Verse:
T.v. cameras, t.v. cameras and stage hands
American bandstand, electric guitars

And he's singin songs, singin songs for the lonely
All the girls with the room keys, they know all his words by heart, by heart and they all sing

Interlude:
Lovely girl won't you stay, won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind, I was blind, now I see
Lovely girl won't you stay, won't you stay, stay with me
All my life I was blind, I was blind, now I see

Lovely girl won't you stay, oh oh ohoh

Chorus:
Oh my my oh hey hey
Here she comes by saving grace
Burn the car and save the plates
She's arrived, my saving grace

Verse:
Ab
I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
                                                Eb
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my hand
          Ab
But I was sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
                                     Eb
With my father in a casket, I had no plans

Interlude: Ab

Pre-Chorus:
Ab                                  Db              Ab
And I left the footprints, the mud stained on the carpet
                                                Eb
And it hardened like my heart did when you left town
      Ab                           Db                Ab    
But I must admit it, that I would marry you in an instant
                                                      Eb
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you around

Chorus:
          Ab        Eb     Db        Ab     Db            Ab          Eb
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
           Ab   Eb             Db   Ab             Db        Ab     Eb
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

Interlude: Ab

Pre-Chorus:
          Ab                       Db                       Ab
While the church discouraged, any lust that burned within me
                                             Eb
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held true
     Ab                     Db       Ab
So I drive a taxi, and the traffic distracts me
         Db               Ab                        Eb 
From the strangers in my backseat, they remind me of you

Chorus:
          Ab        Eb     Db        Ab     Db            Ab          Eb
But I was late for this, late for that, late for the love of my life
           Ab   Eb             Db   Ab             Db        Ab     Eb
And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

Bridge:
        Fm                 Ab           Db     Eb     Fm
And the only gifts from my Lord were a birth and a divorce
         Ab                        Fm            Db        Eb      Ab
But I've read this script and the costume fits, so I'll play my part

Interlude: Ab

Pre-Chorus:
      Ab                Db               Ab
I was Cleopatra, I was taller than the rafters
                                              Eb
But that's all in the past now, gone with the wind
      Ab                    Db                   Ab    
Now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
       Db         Ab
It's a bed and a bathroom
                    Eb

And when I die alone, when I die alone, when I die I'll be on time

Verse:
C
I stood alone, upon the platform in vain
C                                                 F
Puerto Ricans they were playing me salsa in the rain
                                C
With open doors and manual locks
     F        Fm        C
In fast food parking lots


C
I headed West, I was a man on the move
C   
New York had lied to me, I needed the truth
           F                                    C
Oh, I need somebody, needed someone I could trust
         Am               G           F      C
I don't gamble, but if I did I would bet on us

Chorus:
C
Like the Dead Sea
                             F
You told me I was like the Dead Sea

You'll never sink when you are with me

Oh Lord, like the Dead Sea
C
Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
                             F

Honey can't you see,
             G             F    C
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

Verse:
C
You told me you were good at running away
C                                             F
Domestic life, it never suited you like a suitcase
                                         C
You left with just the clothes on your back
      F                Fm           C
You took the rest when you took the map


C
Yes, there are times we live for somebody else
C   
Your father died and you decided to live
            F                                    C
It for yourself you felt, you just felt it was time
          Am                   G            F        C
And I'm glad, cause you with cats, that's just not right

Chorus:

Like the Dead Sea

You told me I was like the Dead Sea

You'll never sink when you are with me
      G           F      C
Oh Lord, like the Dead Sea
C
Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
                             F
The finest words you ever said to me
                  Am
Honey can't you see,
             G             F    C
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea

Bridge:

Would you stay the night?

Chorus:

Dead Sea

You told me I was like the Dead Sea

You'll never sink when you are with me

Oh Lord, I’m your Dead Sea
C
Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
                             F
The finest words you ever said to me
                                  Am
Don’t need to move your feet so quickly,

Oh Lord, I’m your Dead Sea.

When we were younger
We thought everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little
                    Cadd9
And romanticized the time I saw
                     G
Flowers in your hair
        D
Takes a boy to live
      Cadd9                            G
Takes a man to pretend he was there


G
So then we grew a little
Knew a lot
And now we demonstrated it to the cops
             Cadd9
And all the things we said
                         G 
We were self assured
        D
It's a long road to wisdom
       Cadd9                         G
It's a short one to being ignored


         Em     D
Be in my eye
             G
Be in my heart
         Em           D
By in my eye, eyeyeye
             G
Be in my heart


G
So now I think that I could love you back
And I hope its not too late
'Cause youre so attractive
       Cadd9
And the way you move
                     G
I won't close my eyes
         D
Takes a man to live
        Cadd9                             G
Takes a woman to make him compromise


         Em     D
Be in my eye
             G
Be in my heart
         Em           D
By in my eye, eyeyeye
             G
Be in my heart

It was a beautiful day, the sun beat down
          D               E
I had the radio on, I was drivin'
                                              D             
Trees flew by, me and Del was singin', little Runaway

I was flyin'


         A       G      E
Yeah I'm runnin' down a dream

That never would come to me

Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
        G      E
Runnin' down a dream


  E
I felt so good, like anything was possible
      D                             E
I hit cruise control, and rubbed my eyes
                                   
The last tree days, the rain was un-stoppable 
       D                  E
It was always cold, no sunshine


         A       G      E
Yeah I'm runnin' down a dream

That never would come to me

Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads

Runnin' down a dream


  E
I rolled on, as the sky grew dark
          D                        E
I put the pedal down, to make some time

There's something good, waitin' down this road
    D                      E
I'm pickin' up, whatever's mine

On the other side of a street I knew stood a girl that looked like you 
E                         B
I guess thats deja vu but I thought this can't be true cause 
Dbm                       A
You moved to west L.A or New York or Santa Fe or 
E                         B
Wherever to get away from me

Dbm                    A
Oh but that one night was more than just right
E                  B 
I didn't leave you cause I was all through 
Dbm                   A
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell 
E                B
Because I really fell for you


Chorus
A                 E                     B                   Dbm   B   A

Just a shy guy looking for a two ply Hefty bag to hold my i-i-i-i- love 
A                E                    B                               
When you move me everything is groovy they don't like it sue me 
Dbm              B
umm the way you do me 
A                 E                     B                   Abm       Dbm
Oh I swear to you I'll be there for you this is not a drive by-i-i-i-i


Dbm                                     A
On the other side of a downward spiral my love for you went viral 
E                          B
And I loved you every mile you drove away 
Dbm                            A
But now here you are again so let's skip the "how you been" and 
E                             B
Get down to the "more than friends" at last

Dbm                    A
Oh but that one night is still the highlight 
E                  B
I didn't leave you until I came to
Dbm                    A
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell 
E                B
Because I really fell for you


REPEAT Chorus

Please believe that when I leave 
        Dbm            A                   
There's nothing up my sleeve 
             B
But love for you and a little time to get my head together too


Dbm                                   A
On the other side of a street I knew stood a girl that looked like you

I could take the high road

But I know that I'm going low
G                     Bm  A  G Bm A  G Bm A

Verse 1:
D 
This is the sound we make

D 
Where we used to bleed
    Bm              A
And where our blood needs to be

Verse 2:
G 
   In city, I feel my spirit is contained
Bm             A
   Like neon inside the glass, they form my brain
G 
   But I recently discovered

   It's a heatless fire
Bm                     A
   Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
G 
   Begin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
           Bm                               A
   But I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or a close relative to truth
G
   Either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
       Bm                    A                                Bm 
   The softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

I ponder of something great
   F                           G
My lungs will fill and then deflate
     Am
They fill with fire

Exhale desire
   G
I know it's dire

My time today


F
I have these thoughts
            F
So often I ought

To replace that slot
 G                 Am
With what I once bought

'Cause somebody stole
          G
My car radio
                                F
And now I just sit in silence


F                  G
Sometimes quiet is violent
Am
I find it hard to hide it
    G
My pride is no longer inside
      F
It's on my sleeve

My skin will scream
    F
Reminding me of
         G       Am
Who I killed inside my dream
                      G
I hate this car that I'm driving
                       F
There's no hiding for me
                                  F
I'm forced to deal with what I feel
                         G               Am
There is no distraction to mask what is real
G
I could pull the steering wheel


F
I have these thoughts
            F
So often I ought

To replace that slot
 G                 Am
With what I once bought

'Cause somebody stole

My car radio

And now I just sit in silence

Interlude -x4-: F F G Am G

F
I ponder of something terrifying
F                                    G
'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
Am
I find over the course of our human existence
G
One thing consists of consistence
F
And it's that we're all battling fear
     F                                       G
Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Am
Oh my,

Too deep

Please stop thinking
G
I liked it better when my car had sound


F
There are things we can do
               F                              G
But from the things that work there are only two
     Am
And from the two that we choose to do
G
Peace will win

And fear will lose
         F
There's faith and there's sleep
    F                       G
We need to pick one please because
Am
Faith is to be awake
            G
And to be awake is for us to think
                F
And for us to think is to be alive
            F
And I will try with every rhyme
     G     Am
To come across like I am dying
             G                       F
To let you know you need to try to think



I have these thoughts
            F
So often I ought

To replace that slot
 G                 Am
With what I once bought

'Cause somebody stole
          G
My car radio
                                F
And now I just sit in silence

Interlude -x4-: F F G Am G

F
I ponder of something great
   F                           G
My lungs will fill and then deflate
     Am
They fill with fire

Exhale desire
   G
I know it's dire

My time today


F
I have these thoughts
            F
So often I ought

To replace that slot
 G                 Am
With what I once bought

'Cause somebody stole
          G
My car radio
                                F
And now I just sit in silence

 Just because we check the guns at the door

Verse:
Dm7
 There's an infestation in my mind's imagination

 I hope they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smoking them out the basement
Dm7
 This is not rap, this is not hip hop

 Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Dm7
 Rapping to prove nothing

 Just writing to say something
Dm7
 'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushing to say nothing

 This doesn't mean I lost my dream,
Dm7
 Just right now I have a really crazy mind to clean

Verse:
Dm7
 No, I didn't understand a thing you said

 If I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead
Dm7
 Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch,

 Saying stuff like, "You only live once"
Dm7
 You got one time to figure it out

 One time to twist and one time to shout
Dm7
 One time to think, a I say we start now

 Sing it with me, if you know what I'm talking about

Pre-Chorus:

Next thing you know I'm lost at sea

And now that I write and think about it, and the story unfolds

You should take my life, you should take my soul

Chorus:

Remember the moment you know exactly where you're going,
             B                            Gb
'Cause the next moment, before you know it,
                                B
Time is slowing and it's frozen still,
                         Gb
And the window sill looks really nice, right?
          B                                 Gb
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night,
       B         Gb
Right? Fight it, take the pain, ignite it,
     B                             Gb
Tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it,
B                  Gb
To a tree, tell it, "You belong to me,
            B                Gb
This ain't a noose, this is a leash,
                                 Abm
And I have news for you, you must obey me."

Lean with it rock with it when we gonna stop with it
Gb
Lyrics that mean nothing we were gifted with thought
Abm                           E

 If it was our way, we’d have a tempo change every other time change

 Cause our minds change, and what we think is good

 Who would you live and die for on that list?

 But the problem is, there’s another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
        Dm                            Am
 Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality

 If you get between someone I love and me
              G
 You’re gonna get be the heat of my cavalry
Dm                                  Am
 All these songs I’m hearing are so heartless
                                        G
 Don’t trust a perfect person and don’t trust a song that’s flawless

Chorus:
Dm                     Am
 They say stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy
     G
 But we go where we want to
Dm                          Am
 They think this thing is a highway, highway
          G
 But will they be alive tomorrow?
Dm                     Am
 They say stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy

 But we go where we want to

 Hope you're dead, cause how could you sleep at a time like this?

 They rip it, flip it but these are just triplets

 Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line, it's just poetry divided

Verse 1:
Dbm                       Gbm
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die
    Dbm                                Gbm
For now I see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries
     Dbm                      Gbm
For "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow
    Dbm                         Gbm
And one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
         Dbm               Gbm
We're surrounded and we're hounded
        Dbm                          Gbm
There's no "above", or "under", or "around" it
      Dbm                        Gbm
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve
      Dbm                      Gbm
And "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
    Dbm                            Gbm
For if and when we go "above", the question still remains
       Dbm                          Gbm
Are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?
    Dbm                                 Gbm
And that's when going "under" starts to take my wonder

He goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy
     Dbm                                Gbm
When I'd hear him mock me that's almost stopped me
              Dbm               Gbm
Well we're surrounded and we're hounded
        Dbm                  Gbm
There's no above or a secret door. what are we here for
   Dbm                         Gbm

Round interstellar moons
C        G
Speed of light
               F
Into your atmosphere
       C          G
What's your world like?
                F     Em    G
Is the house we built still here?

Girl you know...

Chorus:
         C

Verse:

Fall through the sky
              F
Little specks below
C    G
Magnify
                   F
The further down I go
          C     G
I feel it in my bones
                F
Can you feel it too?
            C          G
Is this the world I've known?
                F     Em    G
Is the house we built still here?
             F    Em G
Is the human race sincere?

Chorus:
         C
When the beat of my drum
          Em
Meets the beat of your heart

You'll know I couldn't love

Any other Any other

Bridge:
F        Em       G
Feel the force of time
                 F
Weighing down my mind
Em           G
Tears you've cried
                 F
Screaming at the sky
Em      G
Come outside

The rays are shining br - i - ght

Where I belong!

Intro -x2-: D Gbm Bm7 G
 
            D
Well I fell down, down, down
          Gbm
Into this dark and lonely hole
             Bm7               G
There was no one there to care about me anymore
      D               Gbm                          Bm7
And I needed a way to climb and grab a hold of the edge
                       G
You were sitting there holding a rope.


             D
And we'll go up, up, up
         Gbm
But I'll fly a little higher
         Bm7                          G
We'll go up in the clouds because the view is a little nicer
   D      Gbm
Up here my dear 
            Bm7                   G
It won't be long now, it won't be long now.


           D
When I get back on land
          Gbm
Well I'll never get my chance
   Bm7                        G
Be ready to live and it'll be ripped right out of my hands
D                   Gbm
Maybe someday we'll take a little ride
         Bm7                 G
We'll go up, up, up and everything will be just fine.


             D
And we'll go up, up, up
         Gbm
But I'll fly a little higher
         Bm7                          G
We'll go up in the clouds because the view is a little nicer
   D      Gbm
Up here my dear 
            Bm7                   G
It won't be long now, it won't be long now.


A
If only I had a little bit more time
A
If only I had a little bit more time with you.


            D
We could go up, up, up
    Gbm
And take that little ride
      Bm7
We'll sit there holding hands
         G
And everything would be just right
    D                  Gbm
And maybe someday I'll see you again
      Bm7                              G
We'll float up in the clouds and we'll never see the end.


             D
And we'll go up, up, up
         Gbm
But I'll fly a little higher
         Bm7                          G
We'll go up in the clouds because the view is a little nicer
   D      Gbm
Up here my dear

It won't be long now, it won't be long now.
