    C                      G
She left without leaving a number,
         C                   G
Said she needed to clear her mind.
   C             D            Em
He figured she'd gone back to Austin,
           C                       D
'Cause she talked about it all the time.
G               C            D
It was almost a year, before she called him up.
G                  C      
Three rings and an answering machine,
D           D
Is what she got:


          G                 Em
If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it.
C                  D          D
If this is Tuesday night, I'm bowling.
Em                         G                         C
If you've got something to sell, you're wastin' your time,
        D      D
I'm not buyin'.
       G       Am7                G
If its anybody else, wait for the tone,
                 C  
You know what to do.
Am      F             D      D
  And P.S, if this is Austin...
        C         G   C   G
I still love you.


    C                     G              
The telephone fell to the counter.
      C                         G
She'd heard, but she couldn't believe.
C            D         Em
What kind of man would hang on that long,
C                           D
What kind of love that must be.
G                C              D
She waited three days, and then she tried again.
G                          C
She didn't know what she'd say,
        D                     D
But she heard three rings and then:


        G                 Em
If it's Friday night, I'm at the ballgame,
    C                   D       D
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain.
Em                    G                 C                D     D
I'm headed out to the lake, and I'll be gone all weekend long.
         G                  Am     
But I'll call you back when I get home
   G           C    
On Sunday afternoon.
Am      F             D       D
  And P.S, if this is Austin...
        G
I still love you.


     Am 
Well this time she left her number,
    Em
But not another word.
         Eb             
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening,
D                     D       D     D 
  And this is what he heard:


          A                Gbm
If you're calling 'bout my heart,

Its still yours.
D                 E       E
  I should listen to it a little more.
Gbm                     E           D
  Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
               E
To know, where I belong.
    A             B              A                    D
And by the way boy, this is no machine you're talkin' to.
Bm          G                 E       E
  Can't you tell that this is Austin...
            D         A   D   A
And I still love you.
        D          A  D   A
I still love you....

Verse:
G                 D
There's more here than what were seeing
Bm       A
A divine conspiracy
G        D
That you, an angel lovely
Bm           A
Could somehow fall for me

You'll always be love's great martyr

Bridge:
Bm
On my own I'm only
G
Half of what I could be
D                  A
I can't do without you

We are stitched together
G
And what love has tethered
D                 A
I pray we never undo

I guess she was tired by, the time I came along.
E      E      A             Gbm7              B
She'd laugh until she cried, I could do no wrong.
Gbm7                     B                  E
She would always save me, because I was her baby.

I worked a factory in Ohio, a shrimp boat in the Bayou,

She said "I don't care if you're 80, you'll always be my baby."


E      E     A            B               E
She loved that photograph, of our whole family.
E       E     A           Gbm7                     B
She'd always point us out, for all her friends to see.

she might not make it through the night.

The whole way I drove 80, so she could see her baby.


     Dbm                                  A
She looked like she was sleepin' and my family had been weepin'

And I'm holdin' the keys to a brand new Chevrolet

Have you been outside, it sure is a nice night
G                              D           A
How bout a little test drive, down by the lake

Bridge:
G
There's a place I know about
A
Where the dirt road runs out
D                   A          Bm
We can try out the four-wheel drive
D                             A
Come on now what do you say, girl I can hardly wait
G                A           D
To get a little mud on the tires

Chorus:
              A
Cause it's a good night
G                               A
To be out there soakin' up the moonlight
G                   D        A
Stake out a little piece of shoreline
D             A               Bm
I've got the perfect place in mind
D
It's in the middle of nowhere

Sun sets about nine this time of year
D               A             Bm                      A
We can throw a blanket down, crickets singing in the background
G                                 D                A
And more stars than you can count on a night this clear

Bridge:
G
I'll tell you what we need to do
A
Is grab a sleepin' bag or two
D           A          Bm
Build us a little campfire
D                            A
And then with a little luck, we might just get stuck

Still can you imagine if we ever struck it,

I'd go shoot tequila take a lime and suck it.

And we'd all tell our bosses they can do the same

We'll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing.

We'd sail around the world and go shore in a day

She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
     Bm                   A
On a snow white Christmas Eve
D                     A      
Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy

      D                       A               Bm            A 
Fifty miles to go and she was running low, on faith and gasoline 
            G
It'd been a long hard year 
          D                       A
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention

She was going way too fast

And before she knew it she was spinning

On a thin black sheet of glass

She saw both their lives flash before her eyes

She didn't even have time to cry
         G                        D
She was so scared, she threw her hands up in the air

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
        Bm            A
And the car came to a stop
      D                     A 
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Bm              A
Sleeping like a rock
             D               A
And for the first time in a long time
    Bm                A
She bowed her head to pray
             G                  D
She said I'm sorry for the way, I've been living my life
  G                                D
I know I've got to change, so from now on tonight

Verse
          G                   C        D
She had a dead-end job at the national bank
       G                   C      D
And a deadbeat husband who always drank
           G                            C      D
So when he didn't come home she had the gin to thank
         Em   D   G  C
For the tears in her eyes
   Em           D            G       A
So Dixie packed up and said her goodbyes...

Chorus
             G     C    D          
And she went driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
G   C       D
Flyin' just fast enough to leave it all behind her
Em                  D                      G           C
But she didn't know till she hit the road, deep in her soul
Am          
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
C                               D
Ain't nothin' stronger than the heart of Dixie

It's got a way of showin' you what you're all about
    G                      C       D
Now Dixie's got her wheels pointed south
              Em    D    G   C
And she ain't never look-ing back
Em     D            G         A
Nobody knew she was brave like that

Grabbed her cheap sunglasses and her lipstick case...

Verse:
A
Two days past eighteen
He was waitin' for the bus in his army greens
D
Sat down in a booth at a caf? there
A
Gave his order to the girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she gave him a smile
So he said would you mind sittin' down for a while
	D			A
And talkin' to me I'm feelin' a little low
		G		D		A
She said I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go

Verse - same as first -:
So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said I bet you got a boyfriend but I don't care
I've got no one to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you?

Chorus:
Gbm   D
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
A
Too young for him they told her
E                         E7
Waitin' for the love of the travelin' soldier
Gbm
Our love will never end
D
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
A
Never more to be alone
E		E7			A
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

Verse - same pattern as before -:
So the letters came
From an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told his heart
It might be love
And all of the things he was so scared of
Said when it's gettin kinda rough over here
I think about that day sittin' down at the pier
And close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Now don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while

Chorus:
Gbm   D
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
A
Too young for him they told her
E                         E7
Waitin' for the love of the travelin' soldier
Gbm
Our love will never end
D
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
A
Never more to be alone
E		E7			A
When the letter says a soldier's coming home

Verse - same pattern as before -:
One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said folks would you bow your heads
For the list of local Vietnam dead
Cryin' all alone under the stands
Was the piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read and no one really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

Chorus:
Gbm   D
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
A
Too young for him they told her
E                         E7
Waitin' for the love of the travelin' soldier
Gbm
Our love will never end
D
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
A
Never more to be alone
E		E7			A

To this day when I hear that song,

I see you standing there on that lawn,

Discount shades, store bought tan,
Bm             A
flip-flops and cut off jeans.
D
Somewhere between that setting sun,
D
I'm On Fire and Born To Run,
G
You looked at me and I was done,
            Bm            A
but we were just getting started.


D
I was singing to you, you were singing to me,
D
I was so alive, never been more free,
G                                       Bm         A
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang oh-woah-oh-woah-ohh.


D
Stayed there till they forced us out,
D
We took the long way to your house,
    G
And I can still hear the sound,
       Bm           A
Of you saying don't go.

Chorus:
D
When I think about you,
A
I think about 17,

Verse:
D
If I bumped in to you by happenstance,
D
You probably wouldn't even know who I am,
   G
But if I whispered your name,

I bet there'd still be a spark.
D                                       D
From back when I was gasoline and this old tattoo had brand new ink,

And we didn't care what your mom would think 'bout your name on my arm.
    D
Baby is it spring or is it summer,
  D
The guitar sound or the beat of the drummer,
    G                               Bm   A
You hear sometimes late at night on your radio.
    D
Even though you're a million miles away,
    D
When you hear Born In The USA,
   G                                Bm     A
Do you relive those Glory Days from so long ago?

When you think about me,

Do you think about my old Jeep,

And I turned on those kc lights and drove all night 
Cuz it felt so right her and I man we felt so right

Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin' 
Hell I can't get you out of my head

Intro: A

Verse:
A
She rolled in from the west

In a summer sun dress
       D                A
Hotter than the heat in July
         
With her wind blown hair

It just wasn't fair
    D                      A
The way she was blowin' my mind
         
Have you ever noticed
                         D                     A
Every hurricane gets its name from a girl like this
        
She's a cat. five kind

Keeps you up at night
        D                   A
Hangin' on to the edge of a kiss
       
Buildup
                  Gbm
She's a beautiful mess
    D
The kind you love to love
                 Gbm
But what happens next
        D                          G
I got a feeling when the sun comes up

Chorus:
                       A
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
          G            D
I'm gonna wish I had a sign
                       A
I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
                G           D
Little lee-way, little more time
             Gbm
Some kind of radar system
             D
Locked in on love
        G                                       D
I got a feeling by the time the night finds the morning
                         A            G D
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning
                         A            G D
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning

Verse -same as first-:
Ain't it funny how it feels
When you're burning your wheels
Somewhere between goin' and gone
You get so lost that you can't turn it off
You give in and you just turn it on
She's a heart full of rain
Red lips like a flame
She's the girl from your favorite song

Bridge:
What a beautiful mess
One part angel, one part perfect, one part brick
The kind of flood you'll never forget

Chorus:
                       A
I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning

I'm gonna wish I had a little heads up
                G           D
Little lee-way, little more time

Some kind of radar system

Locked in on love
        G                                       D
I got a feeling by the time the night finds the morning

I'm gonna wish I had a storm warning

Ooo, Yeah

Going wild child

You were thinking that

They were taking their time

We talked

And we laughed
   Db
We sat real close

By the time they let us go

Verse:
       G                   C
I wish I could take a cab down to the creek
           D
And hang a disco ball from an old oak tree
G                          C
Smoke and drink once in a while
                D
Somehow it'd be good for me
  G                          C
I want a cool chick that'll cook for me
       D
But'll dance on the bar in her tan bare feet
    G                      C                      D
And do what I want when I want and she'll do it with me

Chorus:
G           C           Am
I don't need too much of nothing
D                          G 
I just wanna sing a little chill song
       C                Am
Get my groove on, pour something strong
     D             G
Down in my drink, oh, I know
       C                          Am
That I don't need a whole lot of anything
D                           G

Verse:
G                 C 
Now I don't need a garage full of cars
         D
But I'll take a whole box of Cuban cigars
         G                 C
And I'll smoke 'em nice and slow
               D
Like they were good for me
G                       C
Don't need a ranch or a big piece of land
      D 
But I like to get a little bit of dirt on my hands
G                    C
a big ole couch in a big ole room
Bbm
Still feels lonely when it's just you, yes it does

Bridge:

I'll be OK with what I've done, still having fun

It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
D                  C               G
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
D        C             G
She was 17 and she was far from in between
       D             C        G
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Interlude: D  C  G

It's the simple things in life like when and where

We didn't have no internet, but man I never will forget
    D                 C               G
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things

Makin' love out by the lake to our favorite songs

Sippin' whisky out the bottle not thinkin' 'bout tomorrow

Catchin' walleye from the dock watchin' waves roll off the rocks

She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
      D             C               G
We'd blister in the sun we couldn't wait for night to come
   D              C                G
To hit that sandy place of rock 'n roll

-Solo bit-

Now nothin' seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
   D                    C                G
Oh how we thought those days would never end
    D                 C             G
Sometimes I hear that song and I'll start to sing along

And think man I'd like to see that girl again

I run from prejudice

I run from pessimists

But I run too late
  D A    G
I run my life

Or is it running me

Run from my past
          A
I run too fast

Or too slow it seems

When lies become the truth

That’s when I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
A                        G
Into a new disaster so I run to you

Baby you’re the only one I run to

I run to you

Verse:
   D A    G
We run on fumes
G             D
Your life and mine

Like the sands of time
         G
Slippin’ right on through
        A               G
And our love’s the only truth
       A            G
That’s why I run to you

It will only bring us closer to the love we wanna find

It's never felt so real, no it's never felt so right

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate, tan legs swingin' by a

Georgia plateusa
      E                          B                          Gb
I was lookin' for her boyfriend, thinkin', no way she ain't got one
        E                B                          Gb
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love, tryin' to pour a little sugar in her

Dixie cup
        E                        B                       Gb
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck, she jumped up and cut me off

Chorus:
              E          B                          Gb
She was like, oh my God, this is my song, I've been listenin' to the radio
Abm       Gb
all night long
E                          B                 Gb
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is

She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance, 'fore I said a word, she was
Abm       Gb
takin' my hand
E                       B                 Gb
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out, and she gave me a kiss
              E              B              Gb
And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again
            E              B              Gb
And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again


         E            B             Gb
I'd have gave that DJ my last dime, if he would have played it just one more time
      E                           B                       Gb

      E                         B                  Gb
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove, man, you should have seen

her light up

Abm       Gb
takin' my hand
E                          B             Gb
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
            E              B              Gb
And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again

And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again

The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
                E        B            Gb
You should have seen her smile when I brought out my guitar

Chorus:
              E          B                          Gb

But you don't find roses growing on a stalks of clover

So you better think it over

Well it's sweetin' talkin' you could make it come true

But if that's what it takes to hold, I'd just as soon let you go

But there's one thing I want you to know

You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
          D                                Em
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out

Ab                     Db
I ain't the kind you take home to Mama
 Ab                  Db
I ain't the kind to wear no ring
   Ab         Db
Somehow I always get stronger
  Ab              Db
When I'm on my second drink


Interlude -x2-: Ab  Db


  Ab               Db
Even though I hate to admit it
 Ab               Db
Sometimes I smoke cigarettes
Ab                       Db
The Christian folk say I should quit it
Ab                   Db
I just smile and say, 'God bless'


Interlude: Ab


Chorus:
      Eb
Cause I heard Jesus, He drank wine
      Db             Ab
And I bet we'd get along just fine
          Eb
He could calm a storm and heal the blind
       Db                               Ab
And I bet He'd understand a heart like mine


Interlude -x2-: Ab  Db

Daddy cried when he saw my tattoo
 Ab                Db
Said he loved me anyway

My brother got the brains of the family
Ab                 Db
So I thought I'd learn to sing

Chorus:
      Eb
Cause I heard Jesus, He drank wine

He could calm a storm and heal the blind

       Ab                    Db

 Ab                    Db
When my name's called on the roll
 Ab                      Db
He'll meet me with two long-stemmed glasses
 Ab                   Db
And make a toast to me coming home

Intro: Em

Em
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors 
B7
I screamed his named till the neighbors called the cops
Em 
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver 
      B7                                        Em
Don't know what I did next all I know I couldn't stop


Em
Word got around to the barflies and the baptist 
B7
My mama's phone started ringing off the hook 
Em
I can hear her now saying she ain't gonna have it 
      B7                                          Em
Don't matter how you feel it Only matters how you look 

Chorus:
      Em
Go and fix your make up girl its just a break up 
       B7
Run and hide your crazy and start acting like a lady 
         Em
'Cause I raised you better gotta keep it together
     B7                                                     Em
Even when you fall apart, well, this ain't my mama's broken heart 


Em
Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
        B7
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Em
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
         B7                                             Em
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame


Em
Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
B7
Sometimes revenge is a choice you got a make
Em
My mama came from a softer generation
         B7                                                    Em
When you get a grip and bite your lip just to save her little face

Chorus:
      Em
Go and fix your make up girl its just a break up 
       B7
Run and hide your crazy and start acting like a lady 
         Em
'Cause I raised you better gotta keep it together
     B7                                                     Em
Even when you fall apart, well, this ain't my mama's broken heart 


Em
Powder your nose, paint your toes, line your lips and keep them closed 

Cross your legs, dot your eyes, and never let 'em see you cry

Chorus:
      Em
Go and fix your make up girl its just a break up 
       B7
Run and hide your crazy and start acting like a lady 
         Em
'Cause I raised you better gotta keep it together
     B7                                                     Em
Even when you fall apart, well, this ain't my mama's broken heart

Drinking eggnog instead of beer

We were holding our tongues scratching our heads

Wondering how the hell we got here

Hush hush don't you dare say a word

Hush hush don't you know the truth hurts

Hush hush when push comes to shove

We were sitting around the dinner table

And we were eating our pumpkin pie

While the sugar coated

Pretty little secret was eating everybody alive

Well cheers to the vodka mama's been sneaking

It's best to keep it hush hush

So I snuck at behind the red barn
                    Gb
And I took myself a toke

Since everybody here hates everybody here
                            B
Hell I might as well be the joke

I'm gonna dance up on the table

Singing this little light of mine

Sometimes I can hear this old earth shouting
Through the trees as the wind blows

To get me high up here
Above the noise and city streets
My worries disappear

Intro - x2 -: C G Am F

  C                          G
I walked to the door with you, the air was cold
    Am                           F
But something about it felt like home somehow, and I, 
C                           G
Left my scarf there at your sisters house
        Am                    F-once
And you still got it, in your drawer, even now

Interlude: C G Am F

        C                       G
Oh your sweet dispositon and my wide eyed gaze 
      Am                         F
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
    C                               G
The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
      Am                   F
And I can picture it after all these days


      C                            G
And I know it's long gone and, and magics not here no more
      Am                        G         F G Am G
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
 

      C                          G
Cause there we are again on that little town street
    Am                                F
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin' over at me
           C                      G                 Am   F
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well


      C                         G
Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turing red
                 Am                           F
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed
         C                                      G
And your mothers telling stories 'bout you on a t-ball team
    Am                                    F
You tell me about your past thinkin' your future was me


      C                              G
And I know it's long gone and it was nothing else I could do
      Am                              G                   F G Am G
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed too


      C                        G
Cause here we are again in the middle of the night
   Am                                F
We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
         C                        G                 Am   F
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well

Interlude: C G Am F G

                 C                           G
And maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
               Am                               F
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
        C                        G                Am  F
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
        C                        G
Hey you call me up again just to break me like a promise
   Am                         F
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
          C                           G
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lyin' here
                    Am       F          C G Am F
Cause I remember it all all all too well


C                            G
Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
            Am                           F
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still tryin' to find it
      C                                    G
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
        Am                        F
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
        C                           G
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
           Am                            F
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
             C                     G                Am  F
You cant get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah


      C                         G
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Am                                F
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
       C                      G                Am  F
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
           C                           G
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it oh
         Am                            F 
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
       C                      G                Am F
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

I haven't seen them in a while

You've been good, busier than ever

We small talk, work and the weather

You're guard is up, and I know why


Bm                    A
Because the last time you saw me
           D                          G
It's still burned in the back of your mind 
            Bm          A                  G    
You gave me roses and I left them there to die


   D
So this is me swallowing my pride 
            Gbm
Standing in front of you saying 
                    G
"I'm sorry for that night" and I go

It turns out freedom ain't

When you were mine

I'd go back to December, 
A                           G 
Turn around and make it all right

I go back to December all the time


D Bm G - 2x -


D                         
These days I haven't been sleeping
Bm
Stayin' up playing back myself leaving
G                                      D  A 
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
       D            
Then I think about summer all the beautiful times 
Bm
I watch you laughing from the passenger side
G                               D  A
And realized I loved you in the fall


Bm                     A
And then the cold came the dark days
     D                  G
When fear crept into my mind
            Bm                   
You gave me all your love and
      A           G
All I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride

D  Bm G - 2x -
 

            Bm            G 
I miss your tan skin your sweet smile
   D              A
So good to me, so right
            Bm              G
And how you held me in your arms
               D
That September night
                   A           Bm -stop  
The first time you ever saw me cry
                              G -stop
Maybe this is wishful thinking
                          D
Probably mindless dreaming
- D  -                                    A      
If you loved again I swear I'd love you right


       Bm               A               G 
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
          Bm               A           G 
So if the chain is on your door I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride

He said he never met one girl who

But you start to talk about the movies 
                         Cadd9
That your family watches, every single Christmas
           G
And I will talk about that

G
The tricky thing
                         D
Is yesterday we were just, children
                          Em
Playing soldiers just pre-tending
                          C
Dreaming dreams with happy endings


G
In backyards,
                        D
Winning battles with the, wooden swords
                            Em
But now we've stepped into a, cruel world

                           D
Two steps ahead and staying, on guard
                    Em
Every lesson forms a, new scar
                                C
They never thought you'd make it, this far
G
 But turn around
                            D
Oh, they surrounded you, it's, a showdown
                    Em
And nobody comes to save you now
                                C
But you got something they don't

Yeah, you got something they don't
                    D
You just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown

 You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors

 Its the morning of your very first day

 You know I haven't seen you around, before

 You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
         Em7                        C    
 And soon enough you're best friends
G                                C    
 Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
          Em7                          C    
 We'll be out of here as soon as we can
     G                               C                 
 And then you're on your very first date
                Em7                           C    
 And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying

 And you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
              Em7                            C    
 And you're dancing round your room when the night ends
          C    
 When the night ends

                   G
 'Cause when you're fifteen and 
Em7                       D
 Somebody tells you they love you

 And when you're fifteen
  D                   Em7                   C    
 And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
    Em7                           D
 But in your life you'll do things greater than
            G           D        C    
 Dating the boy on the football team
             D
 But I didnt know it at fifteen

Interlude: G C Em7 C D

G                              C    
 Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
       Em7                            C    
 But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
     G                 C                  Em7
 And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy 
                 C                C    
 Who changed his mind and we both cried

                   G

 Don't forget to look before you fall
Em7                           D
 I've found time can heal most anything
                    G                  D        C    
 And you just might find who you're supposed to be

 I didn't know who I was supposed to be

Intro: E

 E
 I was reminiscing just the other day

 While having coffee all alone and Lord it took me away
            A
 Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time

 Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme


  E
 Took off fast through the green light go

 Hey skip the conversation and you already know
          Dbm
 I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
      A
 And that was the first day


      B     Dbm      A
 And darling it was good 
  B     Dbm     A
 Never looking down
      B           Dbm       A
 And right there where we stood 
             E       A
 Was holy ground


   E
 Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress

 We had this big wide city all to ourselves
                 A
 We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you

 And for the first time I had something to lose


          E
 Well I guess we fell apart in the usual way

 And the story's got dust on every page
      Dbm
 Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
        A
 And I see your face in every crowd

 
      B     Dbm      A
 And darling it was good 
  B     Dbm     A
 Never looking down
      B           Dbm       A
 And right there where we stood 
             E       A    Dbm   A
 Was holy ground


E                                                   A 
 Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through

 But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
E                                               A
 Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
                                                  B
 But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you

 
Dbm      A
 It was good 
  B    Dbm      A
 Never looking down
      B           Dbm       A
 And right there where we stood 
             E     A    Dbm    A
 Was holy ground


E                         A                        Dbm 
 Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
                         A
 But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
E                         A                     Dbm
 Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room

For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals

Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky

But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten

Admirin' at how sharply my first name is written

On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'

    E                       A
And you are the Fruit to my Loom
A
Red Solo cup, you're more than just plastic

You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
    Bm
And believe me that I am not the least bit sarcastic
     E                 A
When I look at you and say

Red Solo cup, you're not just a cup
-No! No! No! God, no! -
You're my-you're my -Friend?- friend

Thank you for being my friend

You're a lover I'm a runner

      Ab              Eb
And I love you but I leave you
        Ab              Eb

But I'm stuck in colder weather
        Ab              Eb
Maybe tomorrow will be better

Can I call you then
                Ab        Eb

And when I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am

It's a shame about the weather

I know soon we'll be together

And I can't wait till then

I can't wait till then
