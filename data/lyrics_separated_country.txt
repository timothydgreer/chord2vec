song over
she left without leaving a number ,
said she needed to clear her mind .
he figured she 'd gone back to austin ,
'cause she talked about it all the time .
it was almost a year , before she called him up .
three rings and an answering machine ,
is what she got :
if you 're calling 'bout the car , i sold it .
if this is tuesday night , i 'm bowling .
if you 've got something to sell , you 're wastin ' your time ,
i 'm not buyin ' .
if its anybody else , wait for the tone ,
you know what to do .
and p.s , if this is austin ...
i still love you .
the telephone fell to the counter .
she 'd heard , but she could n't believe .
what kind of man would hang on that long ,
what kind of love that must be .
she waited three days , and then she tried again .
she did n't know what she 'd say ,
but she heard three rings and then :
if it 's friday night , i 'm at the ballgame ,
and first thing saturday , if it do n't rain .
i 'm headed out to the lake , and i 'll be gone all weekend long .
but i 'll call you back when i get home
on sunday afternoon .
and p.s , if this is austin ...
i still love you .
well this time she left her number ,
but not another word .
then she waited by the phone on sunday evening ,
and this is what he heard :
if you 're calling 'bout my heart ,
i should listen to it a little more .
then it would n't have taken me so long
to know , where i belong .
and by the way boy , this is no machine you 're talkin ' to .
ca n't you tell that this is austin ...
and i still love you .
i still love you ... .
song over
i 've been a walking heartache
i 've made a mess of me
the person that i 've been lately
ai n't who i wan na be
but you stay here right beside me
watch as the storm blows through
and i need you
'cause god gave me you for the ups and downs
god gave me you for the days of doubt
for when i think i 've lost my way
there are no words here left to say , it 's true
god gave me you
gave me you
there 's more here than what were seeing
that you , an angel lovely
could somehow fall for me
you 'll always be love 's great martyr
i 'll be the flattered fool
and i need you
god gave me you for the ups and downs
god gave me you for the days of doubt
for when i think i 've lost my way
there are no words here left to say , it 's true
god gave me you
on my own i 'm only
half of what i could be
i ca n't do without you
we are stitched together
and what love has tethered
i pray we never undo
god gave me you for the ups and downs
god gave me you for the days of doubt
god gave me you for the ups and downs
god gave me you for the days of doubt
for when i think i 've lost my way
there are no words here left to say , it 's true
god gave me you
gave me you
he gave me you

song over
my brother said that i , was rotten to the core .
i was the youngest child , so i got by with more .
i guess she was tired by , the time i came along .
she 'd laugh until she cried , i could do no wrong .
she would always save me , because i was her baby .
i worked a factory in ohio , a shrimp boat in the bayou ,
i drove a truck in birmingham .
turned 21 in cincinnati , i called home to mom and daddy ,
i said `` your boy is now a man . ''
she said `` i do n't care if you 're 80 , you 'll always be my baby . ''
she loved that photograph , of our whole family .
she 'd always point us out , for all her friends to see .
that 's greg he 's doing great , he really loves his job .
and ronnie with his 2 kids , how 'bout that wife he 's got .
and that one 's kinda crazy , but that one is my baby .
i got a call in alabama , said come on home to louisianna
and come as fast as you can fly .
cause your momma really needs you , and says she 's got to see you ,
she might not make it through the night .
the whole way i drove 80 , so she could see her baby .
she looked like she was sleepin ' and my family had been weepin '
by the time that i got to her side .
and i knew that she 'd been taken , and my heart it was breakin ' ,
i never got to say goodbye .
i softly kissed that lady , and cried just like a baby .

i 've got some big news , the bank finally came through
and i 'm holdin ' the keys to a brand new chevrolet
have you been outside , it sure is a nice night
how bout a little test drive , down by the lake
there 's a place i know about
where the dirt road runs out
we can try out the four-wheel drive
come on now what do you say , girl i can hardly wait
to get a little mud on the tires
cause it 's a good night
to be out there soakin ' up the moonlight
stake out a little piece of shoreline
i 've got the perfect place in mind
it 's in the middle of nowhere
only one way to get there
you got ta get a little mud on the tires
moonlight on a duck blind , catfish on a trot line
sun sets about nine this time of year
we can throw a blanket down , crickets singing in the background
and more stars than you can count on a night this clear
i 'll tell you what we need to do
is grab a sleepin ' bag or two
build us a little campfire
and then with a little luck , we might just get stuck
let 's get a little mud on the tires
cause it 's a good night
to be out there soakin ' up the moonlight
stake out a little piece of shoreline
i 've got the perfect place in mind
it 's in the middle of nowhere
only one way to get there
you got ta get a little mud on the tires
and then with a little luck , we might just get stuck
let 's get a little mud on the tires

well , i won two dollars on a scratch off ticket ,
so i went back to the
counter and i bought two more with it .
and i won ten bucks and that was just right ,
so i bought a six-pack and a bag of ice .
you know even if our ship came in and this is all we got ,
it ai n't like we
really need a million dollar yacht cause ,
we got an inner-tube , we got trailer hitch .
we 're near the river and far from rich .
but we 've got each other and gas in the tank ,
and we 're laughing all the way
to the river bank .
still can you imagine if we ever struck it ,
i 'd go shoot tequila take a lime and suck it .
and we 'd all tell our bosses they can do the same
we 'll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing .
we 'd sail around the world and go shore in a day
but 'til that dream comes true why do n't you grab your bikini . cause ,
we got an inner-tube , we got trailer hitch .
we 're near the river and far from rich .
but we 've got each other and gas in the tank ,
and we 're laughing all the way
to the river bank .
however it goes -whatever happens- ,
we got it made -in these shades-
cause , baby we can float -behind this boat-
we can ride a wave .
we got an inner-tube , we got trailer hitch .
we 're near the river and far from rich .
but we 've got each other and gas in the tank ,
and it 's a beautiful day .
we 're laughing all the way to the river bank .
song over
when your wheelhouse , is the land of cotton
the first time you leave , it can be strange , it can be shocking
not everybody drives a truck , not everybody drinks sweet tea
not everybody owns a gun , wears a ball cap , boots and jeans
not everybody goes to church , or watches every nascar race
not everybody knows the words to `` ring of fire '' or `` amazing grace ''
oh , dixie land , i hope you understand
when i miss my tennessee home
and i ’ ve been away way too long
i ca n't see this world unless i go
outside my southern comfort zone
i have walked the streets of rome , i have been to foreign lands
i know what it 's like to talk , and have nobody understand
i have seen the eiffel tower , lit up on a paris night
i have kissed a west coast girl , underneath the northern lights
i know what it 's like to meet , the only one like me
to take a good hard look around , and be a minority
and i miss my tennessee home
i can see the ways that i ’ ve grown
i ca n't see this world unless i go
outside my southern comfort zone
i miss your biscuits and your gravy , fireflies dancing in the night
you have fed me , you have saved me , billy graham and martha white
i ’ ve since become a drifter , and i just ca n't wait to pack
cause i know the road i leave on , it will always bring me back
i wish i was in dixie , away
and i miss my tennessee home
i 've been away way too long
i ca n't see this world unless i go
outside my southern comfort zone
look away , look away
i wish i was in dixie , away , look away
i wish i was in the land of cotton , look away
away , look away
live and die in dixie
in dixie
song over
i had a dream about a burning house
you were stuck inside
i could n't get you out
i laid beside you and pulled you close
and the two of us went up in smoke
love is n't all that it seems i did you wrong
i 'll stay here with you , until this dream is gone
i 've been sleepwalking
been wandering all night
trying to take what 's lost and broken and
make it right
i 've been sleepwalking
too close to the fire
but it 's the only place that i can hold you tight
in this burning house
see you at a party and you look the same
i could take you back
but people do n't ever change
wish that we could go back in time
and i 'd be the one you thought you 'd find
love is n't all that it seems i did you wrong
i 'll stay here with you , until this dream is gone
i 've been sleepwalking
been wandering all night
trying to take what 's lost and broken and
make it right
i 've been sleepwalking
too close to the fire
but it 's the only place that i can hold you tight
in this burning house
the flames are getting bigger now
in this burning house
i can hold on to you somehow
in this burning house
oh when i do n't want to wake up
in this burning house
i 've been sleepwalking
been wandering all night
trying to take what 's lost and broken and
make it right
i 've been sleepwalking
too close to the fire
but it 's the only place that i can hold you tight
in this burning house

right now he 's probably slow dancing with a bleached-blond tramp ,
and she 's probably getting frisky
right now , he 's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she
ca n't shoot whiskey
right now , he 's probably up behind her with a pool-stick , showing her how
to shoot a combo and he do n't know
that i dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up four wheel drive ,
carved my name into his leather seat
i took a louisville slugger to both head lights , slashed a hole in all 4 tires
and maybe next time he 'll think before he cheats .
right now , she 's probably up singing some white-trash version of shania karoke
right now , she 's probably saying `` i 'm drunk '' and he 's a thinking that he 's gon na lucky ,
right now , he 's probably dabbing 3 dollars worth of that bathroom polo
and he do n't know
that i dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up four wheel drive ,
carved my name into his leather seat
i took a louisville slugger to both head lights , slashed a hole in all 4 tires
and maybe next time he 'll think before he cheats .
i might save a little trouble for the next girl ,
cause the next time that he cheats
oh , you know it wo n't be on me !
ohh ... not on me

dry lightning cracks across the skies
those storm clouds gather in her eyes
her daddy was a mean ole mister
mama was an angel in the ground
the weather man called for a twister
she prayed blow it down
there 's not enough rain in oklahoma
to wash the sins out of that house
there 's not enough wind in oklahoma
to rip the nails out of the past
shatter every window till it 's all blown away
every brick , every board , every slamming door flown away
till there 's nothing left standing
nothing left to yesterday
every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
blown away
she heard those sirens screaming out
her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
she locked herself in the cellar
listened to the screaming of the wind
some people called it taking shelter
she called it sweet revenge
shatter every window till it 's all blown away
every brick , every board , every slamming door flown away
till there 's nothing left standing
nothing left to yesterday
every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
blown away
there 's not enough rain in oklahoma
to wash the sins out of that house
there 's not enough wind in oklahoma
to rip the nails out of the past
shatter every window till it 's all blown away
every brick , every board , every slamming door flown away

you better take it from me
that boy is like a disease
you 're running , you 're trying , you 're trying to hide
and you 're wondering why you ca n't get free
he 's like a curse , he 's like a drug
you get addicted to his love
you wan na get out but he 's holding you down
cause you ca n't live without one more touch
he 's a good time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
looks like a cool drink of water
but he 's candy-coated misery
he 's the devil in disguise
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you do n't want to fight
you better run for your life
he 's a good time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
looks like a cool drink of water
but he 's candy-coated misery
he 's the devil in disguise
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you do n't want to fight
you better run for your life
run run away , do n't let him mess with your mind
he 'll tell you anything you want to hear
he 'll break your heart , it 's just a matter of time
but just remember
he 's a good time cowboy casanova
leaning up against the record machine
looks like a cool drink of water
but he 's candy-coated misery
he 's the devil in disguise
and he only comes out at night
gives you feelings that you do n't want to fight
you better run for your life
song over
she was driving last friday on her way to cincinnati
on a snow white christmas eve
going home to see her mama and her daddy
with the baby in the backseat
fifty miles to go and she was running low , on faith and gasoline
it 'd been a long hard year
she had a lot on her mind and she did n't pay attention
she was going way too fast
and before she knew it she was spinning
on a thin black sheet of glass
she saw both their lives flash before her eyes
she did n't even have time to cry
she was so scared , she threw her hands up in the air
jesus take the wheel
take it from my hands
cause i ca n't do this on my own
i 'm letting go
so give me one more chance
save me from this road i 'm on
jesus take the wheel
it was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
and the car came to a stop
she cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
sleeping like a rock
and for the first time in a long time
she bowed her head to pray
she said i 'm sorry for the way , i 've been living my life
i know i 've got to change , so from now on tonight
jesus take the wheel
take it from my hands
cause i ca n't do this on my own
i 'm letting go
just give me one more chance
save me from this road i 'm on
oh jesus take the wheel
ohh i 'm letting go
so give me one more chance
save me from this road i 'm on
just from this road i 'm on
jesus take the wheel
oh , take it , take it from me
oh whaaaa ooooh ...

last night i got served a little too much of that poison baby
last night i did things i 'm not proud of
and i got a little crazy
last night i met a guy on the dance floor
and i let him call me baby
and i do n't even know his last name
oh , my mama would be so ashamed
it started off `` hey cutie , where ya from ? ''
and then it turned into `` oh no , what have i done ? ''
and i do n't even know his last name
we left the club right around three o'clock in the morning
his pinto sitting there in the parking lot well it should have been a
warning
i had no clue what i was getting into
so i blame it on the cuervo
and i do n't even know his last name
oh , my mama would be so ashamed
it started off `` hey cutie , where ya from ? ''
and then it turned into `` oh no , what have i done ? ''
and i do n't even know his last name
today i woke up thinkin ' about elvis somewhere in vegas
i 'm not sure how i got here
or how this ring on my left hand just appeared out of nowhere
i take the chips and the pinto and hit the road
they say what happens here stays here
all of this will disappear
and i do n't even know my last name
oh , my mama would be so ashamed
it started off `` hey cutie , where ya from ? ''
and then it turned into `` oh no , what have i done ? ''
and i do n't even know my last name
what have i done
what have i done
what have i done
oh , what have i done
i do n't even know my last name

another new mom and dad , another school
another house that 'll never be home
when people ask him
how he likes this place
he looks up and says with a smile upon his face
this is my temporary home

windows and rooms that i 'm passin ' through
this is just a stop , on the way to where i 'm going

two black cadillacs driving in a slow parade
headlights shining bright in the middle of the day
one is for his wife
the other for the woman who loved him at night
two black cadillacs meeting for the first time
and the preacher said he was a good man
and his brother said he was a good friend
but the women in the two black veils did n't bother to cry
yeah they took turns laying a rose down
threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
he 's not the only one who had a secret to hide
bye bye , bye bye
two black cadillacs , two black cadillacs
two months ago his wife called the number on his phone
turns out he been lying to both of them for oh so long
they decided then he 'd never get away for doing this to them
two black cadillacs waiting for the right time , the right time
and the preacher said he was a good man
and his brother said he was a good friend
but the women in the two black veils did n't bother to cry
yeah they took turns laying a rose down
threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
he 's not the only one who had a secret to hide
bye bye , bye bye , bye bye
yeah yeah
it was the first time and last time they saw each other face to face
they shared a crimson smile and just walked away
and the preacher said he was a good man
and his brother said he was a good friend
but the women in the two black veils did n't bother to cry
yeah they took turns laying a rose down
threw a handful of dirt into the deep ground
he 's not the only one who had a secret to hide
bye bye , bye bye , bye bye
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah

i wish i could break your heart
i wish i could bring you down
just for a second , teach you a lesson
about being alone in the dark
i wish i could make you cry
so hard you can barely breathe
and maybe you just might know what it feels like
oh to be me
well the truth is that i never ever wan na hurt you baby
but it 'd be nice to know that i could
be strong enough to pull you under
throw you back a little thunder
even though i never would
i wish i could break , i wish i could break your heart
i wish i could crush your dreams
i wish i could turn back time
boy i 'd lead you on light the fuse , drop the bomb
just so i 'd be the first to leave
well the truth is that i never ever wan na hurt you baby
but it 'd be nice to know that i could
be strong enough to pull you under
throw you back a little thunder
even though i never would
i wish i could break , i wish i could break your heart
i wish i could break your heart
i wish i could make you cry
i wish i could turn back time
well the truth is that i never ever wan na hurt you baby
but it 'd be nice to know that i could
be strong enough to pull you under
throw you back a little thunder
even though i never would
i wish i could break your heart
i wish i could break your heart
i wish i could break your heart

i 'm finally holdin ' what i 've been hopin ' for
we had a few drinks
some laughs at the bar
stayed out too late
and went a little too far
oh but wakin ' up
with you on my chest
i had a pounding heart , and achin ' head , and no regrets
who knows , we might go down in flames
but then again i might just change your name
could it be i 'm finally holding
what i 've been hoping for
could it be the end of just friends
the start of something more
oh the way i 'm feeling now
it 's worth sticking around to see
is this love
or could it be
rule number one
friends do n't break
we could write it off
as a sweet mistake
only time will tell
if we were wrong or right
all i know is i do n't want to be alone tonight
who knows , we might go down in flames
but then again i might just change your name
could it be i 'm finally holding
what i 've been hoping for
could it be the end of just friends
the start of something more
oh the way i 'm feeling now
it 's worth sticking around to see
is this love
or could it be
we wound up here so naturally
me and you baby you and me , could it be-could it be- , could it be-could it be-
i 'm finally holding
what i 've been hoping for
could it be the end of just friends
and the start of something more
oh the way i 'm feeling now
it 's worth sticking around to see
is this love
or could it be
is this love
or could it be
song over
she had a dead-end job at the national bank
and a deadbeat husband who always drank
so when he did n't come home she had the gin to thank
for the tears in her eyes
so dixie packed up and said her goodbyes ...
and she went driving so far away nobody 's gon na find her
flyin ' just fast enough to leave it all behind her
but she did n't know till she hit the road , deep in her soul
she 's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
ai n't nothin ' stronger than the heart of dixie
it 's a funny thing when your world falls down
it 's got a way of showin ' you what you 're all about
now dixie 's got her wheels pointed south
and she ai n't never look-ing back
nobody knew she was brave like that
and she went driving so far away nobody 's gon na find her
flyin ' just fast enough to leave it all behind her
but she did n't know till she hit the road , deep in her soul
she 's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
ai n't nothin ' stronger than the heart of dixie
yeah , dixie woke up to the truth one day
grabbed her cheap sunglasses and her lipstick case ...
and she went driving so far away nobody 's gon na find her
flyin ' just fast enough to leave it all behind her
but she did n't know till she hit the road , deep in her soul
she 's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
ai n't nothin ' stronger than the heart of dixie
-the heart of dixie-
o-o-ooh -the heart of dixie-

i 've got a stereo and the best of patsy cline

but as far as i can see , i 've got everything i want
cause i 've got a roof over my head ,
the woman i love laying in my bed
and it 's alright , alright
i 've got shoes under my feet
forever in her eyes staring back at me
and it 's alright , alright
and i 've got all i need
and it 's alright by me
maybe later on we 'll walk down to the river
lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
it may not be no french riviera
but it 's all the same to me as long as i 've got you
it may be a simple life , but that 's okay
if you ask me baby , i think i 've got it made
cause i 've got a roof over my head ,
the woman i love laying in my bed
and it 's alright , alright
i 've got shoes under my feet
forever in her eyes staring back at me

for giving me everything i ever could dream of

he didnt have to wake up
he 'd been up all nite
lying there in bed listening
to his new born baby cry
he makes a pot of coffee
he splashes water on his face
his wife gives him a kiss and says
it gon na be ok
it wont be like this for long
one day we 'll look back laugh ' n
at the week we brought her home
this phase is gon na fly by
so baby just hold on
it wont be like this for long
four years later 'bout four thirty
she 's crawling in there bed
and when he drops her off at preschool
she 's clinging to his leg
the teacher peels her off of him
he says what can i do
she says now dont you worry
this will only last a week or two
it wont be like this for long
one day soon you 'll drop her off
and she wont even know your gone
this phase is gon na fly by
if you can just hold on
it wont be like this for long
some day soon she 'll be a teenager
and at times he 'll think she hates him
then he 'll walk her down the isle
and raise her vale
but right now she up and cry ' n
and the truth is that he dont mind
as he kisses her good night
and she says her prayers
he lays down there beside her
'til her eyes are finally closed
and just watch ' n her it breaks his heart
cause he already knows
it wont be like this for long
one day soon that little girl is gon na be
all grown up and gone
yeah this phase is gon na fly by
so he 's try ' n to hold on
'cause it wont be like this for looooooong
it wont be like this for long

i said i wan na touch the earth
i wan na break it in my hands
i wan na grow something wild and unruly
i wan na sleep on the hard ground
in the comfort of your arms
on a pillow of blue bonnets
in a blanket made of stars
oh it sounds good to me ,
cowboy take me away
fly this girl as high as you can
into the wild blue
set me free oh i pray
closer to heaven above and
closer to you
closer to you
i wan na walk and not run
i wan na skip and not fall
i wan na look at the horizon
and not see a building standing tall
wan na be the only one
for miles and miles
except for maybe you
and your simple smile
oh it sounds good to me
yes it sounds so good to me
cowboy take me away
fly this girl as high as you can
into the wild blue

sat down in a booth at a caf ? there
gave his order to the girl with a bow in her hair he 's a little shy so she gave him a smile so he said would you mind sittin ' down for a while
and talkin ' to me i 'm feelin ' a little low
she said i 'm off in an hour and i know where we can go
i cried never gon na hold the hand of another guy
too young for him they told her
waitin ' for the love of the travelin ' soldier
our love will never end
waitin ' for the soldier to come back again
never more to be alone
when the letter says a soldier 's coming home
i cried never gon na hold the hand of another guy
too young for him they told her
waitin ' for the love of the travelin ' soldier
our love will never end
waitin ' for the soldier to come back again
never more to be alone
when the letter says a soldier 's coming home
for the list of local vietnam dead cryin ' all alone under the stands was the piccolo player in the marching band and one name read and no one really cared but a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair
i cried never gon na hold the hand of another guy
too young for him they told her

waitin ' for the soldier to come back again
never more to be alone

your dress , my shirt , we love , i live and never learn
i crash , i burn , you leave , i hurt , like clockwork

i see a freight train comin ' and i just stand there on the tracks , girl
somebody 'd be gettin ' rich if they were placin ' bets

song over
way back on the radio dial
every note just wrapped around your soul
from steel guitar to memphis all the way to rock and roll
whoa oah i can hear 'em saying
i can hear the ringing of a beat up old guitar
woah oah i can hear 'em saying
keep on dreaming even if it breaks your heart
downtown where i used to wander
old enough to get there but too young to get inside
i would stand out on the sidewalk
listen to the music playing every friday night
whoa oah i can hear 'em playing
i can hear the ringing of a beat up old guitar
woah oah i can hear 'em saying
keep on dreaming even if it breaks your heart
some dreams stay with you forever
drag you around and lead you back to where you were
some dreams keep on getting better
got to keep believing if you want to know for sure
whoa oah i can hear 'em saying
i can hear the ringing of a beat up old guitar
woah oah i can hear 'em saying
keep on dreaming even if it breaks your heart
whoa oah i can hear 'em saying
i can hear the ringing of a beat up old guitar
woah oah i can hear 'em saying
keep on dreaming even if it breaks your heart
song over
to this day when i hear that song ,
i see you standing there on that lawn ,
discount shades , store bought tan ,
flip-flops and cut off jeans .
somewhere between that setting sun ,
i 'm on fire and born to run ,
you looked at me and i was done ,
but we were just getting started .
i was singing to you , you were singing to me ,
i was so alive , never been more free ,
fired up my daddy 's lighter and we sang oh-woah-oh-woah-ohh .
stayed there till they forced us out ,
we took the long way to your house ,
and i can still hear the sound ,
of you saying do n't go .
when i think about you ,
i think about 17 ,
i think about my old jeep ,
i think about the stars in the sky .
funny how a melody sounds like a memory ,
like a soundtrack to a july saturday night ,
springsteen .
if i bumped in to you by happenstance ,
you probably would n't even know who i am ,
but if i whispered your name ,
i bet there 'd still be a spark .
from back when i was gasoline and this old tattoo had brand new ink ,
and we did n't care what your mom would think 'bout your name on my arm .
baby is it spring or is it summer ,
the guitar sound or the beat of the drummer ,
you hear sometimes late at night on your radio .
even though you 're a million miles away ,
when you hear born in the usa ,
do you relive those glory days from so long ago ?
when you think about me ,
do you think about 17 ,
do you think about my old jeep ,
think about the stars in the sky .
funny how a melody sounds like a memory ,
like a soundtrack to a july saturday night ,
springsteen , springsteen .
whoah-oh-oh-oh-oh , woah-oh-oh-oh-oh , woah-oh-oh-oh-oh , ohh-ohh .
funny how a melody sounds like a memory
like a soundtrack to a july saturday night
springsteen ,
springsteen
oh springsteen
whoah-oh-oh-oh-oh , woah-oh-oh-oh-oh , woah-oh-oh-oh-oh , ohh-ohh . x4

every little river , run through your mind
you give and you take , you come and you go
you leave me here wondering if i 'll ever know
how much you care , or how much you do n't
whatever you need , whatever you want
if you 're gon na be somebody 's heartbreak ,
if you 're gon na be somebody 's mistake ,
if you 're gon na be somebody 's first time ,
somebody 's last time , baby be mine .
if you 're lookin ' to be somebody 's just friends ,
a little laugh , a little love never callin ' again ,
that 's just fine
if you 're gon na be somebody 's heartbreak , be mine .
well i guess that all i 'm trying to tell you
is one minute with you girl , is better than two without
oh , i wo n't be a fool , but i ca n't play cool ,
so , i 'm playin ' it safe and i 'm breakin ' the rules
i 'm wishin ' i had what i know that you got ,
so if you 're comin ' my way , then please do n't stop
if you 're gon na be somebody 's heartbreak ,
if you 're gon na be somebody 's mistake ,
if you 're gon na be somebody 's first time ,
somebody 's last time , baby be mine .
if you 're lookin ' to be somebody 's just friends ,
a little laugh , a little love never callin ' again ,
that 's just fine
if you 're gon na be somebody 's heartbreak , be mine .
but if you 're gon na be somebody 's heartbreak , somebody 's mistake ,
somebody 's first time , or their last time , baby , be mine
if you 're lookin ' to be somebody 's just friends ,
a little laugh , a little love never callin ' again ,
that 's just fine
if you 're gon na be somebody 's heartbreak , be mine .
song over
she rolled in from the west
hotter than the heat in july
the way she was blowin ' my mind
every hurricane gets its name from a girl like this
hangin ' on to the edge of a kiss
she 's a beautiful mess
the kind you love to love
but what happens next
i got a feeling when the sun comes up
i 'm gon na wish i had a storm warning
i 'm gon na wish i had a sign
i 'm gon na wish i had a little heads up
little lee-way , little more time
some kind of radar system
locked in on love
i got a feeling by the time the night finds the morning
i 'm gon na wish i had a storm warning
i 'm gon na wish i had a storm warning
i 'm gon na wish i had a storm warning
i 'm gon na wish i had a sign
i 'm gon na wish i had a little heads up
little lee-way , little more time
some kind of radar system
locked in on love
i got a feeling by the time the night finds the morning
i 'm gon na wish i had a storm warning
i 'm gon na wish i had a storm warning
i 'm gon na wish i had a sign
i 'm gon na wish i had a little heads up

locked in on love
i 'm gon na wish i had a storm warning
i 'm gon na wish i had a sign

back down a country road
the girls are always hot & the beer is ice cold
cadillac horns on the hood
my buddy frankie had his dad hook him up good
girls smiled when we rode by
they 'd hop in the back & we 'd cruise to the riverside
wohh never gon na grow up
wohh never gon na slow down
wohh we were shinin ' like lighters in the dark
in the middle of a rock show
wohh we were doin ' it right
wohh we were comin ' alive
wohh yeah caught up in a southern summer
barefoot blue jean night
blue eyes & auburn hair
sittn ' lookin ' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
new to town and new to me
her ruby red lips were sippin ' on sweet tea
shot me a look like a shootin ' star
so i grabbed a beer & my ole guitar , then we
sat around til the break of dawn
howlin ' & singin ' to our favorite songs
wohh never gon na grow up

taking down your neighbour wo n't take you any higher
i burned my own damn finger poking someone else 's fire
i 've never gotten taller making someone else feel small
if you ai n't got nothing nice to say do n't say nothing at all
just hoe your own row and raise your own babies
smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
mend your own fences and own your own crazy
mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
nobody 's perfect , we 've all lost and we 've all lied
most of us have cheated the rest of us have tried
the holiest of the holy even slip from time to time
we 've all got dirty laundry hanging on the line
so hoe your own row and raise your own babies
smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
mend your own fences and own your own crazy
mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
pouring salt in my sugar wo n't make yours any sweeter
pissing in my yard ai n't gon na make yours any greener
i would n't know about the rocks in your shoes
so i 'll just do me and honey you can just do you
so hoe your own row and raise your own babies
smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
mend your own fences and own your own crazy
mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy

same hurt in every heart .
same trailer , different park .

and just like dust we settle in this town .
on this broken merry go 'round and round and round we go , where it stops
nobody knows
and it ai n't slowin down , this merry go round
we think the first time 's good enough ,
so we hold on to highschool love , say we wo n't end up like our parents .
tiny little boxes in a row ,
ai n't what you want it 's what you know , just happy in the shoes your wearin .
same checks we 're always cashin ,
to buy a little more distraction .

i was thinking you were crazy as hell
and you were so innocent
but you were stealing my heart
i fell in love in the back of a cop car

they sure threw those cuffs on quick
you tried to sweet talk 'em
they did n't fall for it , but i did
you were on the left
i was on the right

when you asked him for a light
and i laughed
he got mad and slammed the door

song over
i wish i could take a cab down to the creek
and hang a disco ball from an old oak tree
smoke and drink once in a while
somehow it 'd be good for me
i want a cool chick that 'll cook for me
but 'll dance on the bar in her tan bare feet
and do what i want when i want and she 'll do it with me
i do n't need too much of nothing
i just wan na sing a little chill song
get my groove on , pour something strong
down in my drink , oh , i know
that i do n't need a whole lot of anything
i just want a little bit of everything

na na na na , na na na na
now i do n't need a garage full of cars
but i 'll take a whole box of cuban cigars
and i 'll smoke 'em nice and slow
like they were good for me
do n't need a ranch or a big piece of land
but i like to get a little bit of dirt on my hands
a big ole couch in a big ole room
still feels lonely when it 's just you , yes it does
i do n't need too much of nothing

song over
i ca n't sleep
ai n't no sleep a'coming
i 'm just lying here thinking 'bout you
i 'm in deep
falling deep into the picture in my mind of everything we 're gon na do
over at the lake and down by the river
you can feel it start to rise
wan na jump in my car , go wherever you are
'cause i need you by my side
it 's gon na be a long , hot summer , we should be together
with your feet up on the dashboard now
singing along with the radio , it 's such a beautiful sound
and when you say my name in the middle of the day , i swear i see the stars
come out
when you hold my hand in the back of my mind , just waiting on the sun to go
down , the sun to go down
i wan na see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
i try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
one chance of meeting , you were walking by me on the street and i said hi
and that was the beginning of my heart spinnin '
like these wheels in my head tonight
it 's gon na be a long , hot summer , we should be together
with your feet up on the dashboard now
singing along with the radio , it 's such a beautiful sound
and when you say my name in the middle of the day , i swear i see the stars
come out
when you hold my hand in the back of my mind , just waiting on the sun to go
down , the sun to go down
the only place that i wan na be is where you are
'cause anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far
it 's gon na be a long , hot summer , we should be together
all i really want is more than this moment right now
and when you say my name in the middle of the day , i swear i see the stars
come out
and when you 're holdin my hand and i look into your eyes
i swear it looks like you 're waiting for the sun to go
down , the sun to go down

the way that it was and could 've been surrounds me ,
i 'll never get over you , walkin awa - y
i 've never been the kind to ever let my feelings show ,
and i thought that being strong ment never losin ' your self control
but i 'm just drunk enough , to let go of my pain ,
to hell with my pride , let it fall like rain , from my eyes ,
tonight i wan na cry .
would it help if i turned this sad song on ?
`` all ny myself '' would sure hit me hard now that your gone ,
or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters ,
it 's gon na hurt bad before it gets better ,
but i 'll never get over you , by hidin ' this wa - y

cuz i 'll be there , in the back of your mind
from the day we met 'til you were making me cry
and it 's just too bad , you 're already had the best days
the best days of your life
ai n't it a shame ?
a shame that every time you hear my name
brought up in a casual conversation
you ca n't think straight
and ai n't it sad ?
you can forget about what we had
take a look at her and do you like what you see ?
or do you wish it was me
cuz i 'll be there , in the back of your mind
from the day we met 'til you were making me cry
and it 's just too bad , you 're already had the best days
the best days of your life
and does she know ?
know about the times you used to hold me
wrapped me in your arms and how you told me
i 'm the only one
i heard about
yeah , someone told me once , when you were out
she went a little crazy ran her mouth about me
ai n't jealousy fun -- -ny ?
cuz i 'll be there , in the back of your mind
from the day we met 'til you were making me cry
and it 's just too bad , you 're already had the best days
the best days of your life
i was head-over-heals 'til you threw away `` us ''
and it 's just too bad you 've , already had the best days
the best days of your life
i heard you 're gon na get married
have a nice little family
live out my dreams with someone new
but , i 've been told that a cheater
is always a cheater
i 've got my pride , and she 's got you ...

song over
well i see the souls of so many friends ,
and i see us all back here again .
with sandy floors and ceiling fans ,
a rastafarian one-man band with songs
that fill my memories like a tip jar .
yeah , that 's what i see , when i see this bar .
i see tourists at christmas time ,
and i taste beers with a hint of lime .
i feel lonely cause it 's not the same ,
different faces and different names ,
living like pirates out among the stars .
yeah , that 's what i see , when i see this bar .
pieces of our past slowly slip away ,
but time just stands still when i walk in this place .
and i see a kid coming into his own
and a man learning to move on .
somehow trying to find his way ,
a dreamer betting on blind faith
chasing that sun and following his heart .
yeah , that 's what i see , when i see this bar .
pieces of our past slowly slip away ,
but time just stands still when i walk in this place .
a few have moved on back to maine ,
jacksonville and key biscayne .
some are still living the dream ,
stuck in still life it seems .
no matter where they 've been , or where they are ,
yeah , i see 'em here , when i see this bar .
when i see this bar .
i wonder where we go from here
-that 's what i see when i see this bar-
life ai n't over but it 's always near
-that 's what i see when i see this bar-
i think about all the good times that we had
-that 's what i see when i see this bar-
it makes me happy and it makes me sad
-that 's what i see when i see this bar-
how could we be so close , now so far apart
-that 's what i see when i see this bar-
that 's what i feel , that 's what i see -when i see this bar-
yeah we were living like pirates and wannabe stars
that 's what i see when i see this bar
that 's what i see when i see this bar
song over
it was 1989 , my thoughts were short my hair was long
caught somewhere between a boy and man
she was 17 and she was far from in between
it was summertime in northern michigan
splashin ' thru the sandbar , talkin ' by the campfire
it 's the simple things in life like when and where
we did n't have no internet , but man i never will forget
the way the moonlight shined upon her hair
and we were tryin ' different things and we were smokin ' funny things
makin ' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
sippin ' whisky out the bottle not thinkin ' 'bout tomorrow
singin ' sweet home alabama all summer long
singin ' sweet home alabama all summer long
catchin ' walleye from the dock watchin ' waves roll off the rocks
she 'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
we 'd blister in the sun we could n't wait for night to come
to hit that sandy place of rock ' n roll
and we were tryin ' different things and we were smokin ' funny things
makin ' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
sippin ' whisky out the bottle not thinkin ' 'bout tomorrow
singin ' sweet home alabama all summer long
singin ' sweet home alabama all summer long
now nothin ' seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
oh how we thought those days would never end
sometimes i hear that song and i 'll start to sing along
and think man i 'd like to see that girl again
and we were tryin ' different things and we were smokin ' funny things
makin ' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
sippin ' whisky out the bottle not thinkin ' 'bout tomorrow
singin ' sweet home alabama all summer long
singin ' sweet home alabama all summer long

hey pretty girl , wo n't you look my way

hey pretty girl , wo n't you look my way
hey pretty girl , can i have this dance
and the next one after that

hey pretty girl , it feels so right
just like it 's meant to be
all wrapped up in my arms so tight
hey pretty girl , it feels so right

and time moves faster than you think
hey pretty girl , you did so good

and a fighters heart like i knew she would
hey pretty girl , you did so good
hey pretty girl when i see the light
when it 's my time to go

pretty little girl and a beautiful wife
song over
something about a truck in a farmer 's field
a no trespass sign , you got time to kill
nobody 's gon na get hurt , so what 's the big deal
something about a truck in a farmer 's field
something about beer sitting on ice
after a long hard day makes it taste just right
on that dropped tailgate on a summer night
something about beer sitting on ice
something about a girl in a red sundress
with an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
in that farmer 's field , will make a boy a man
something about a girl in a red sundress
something about a kiss that 's gon na lead to more
on that dropped tailgate , back behind the corn
the most natural thing , you 've ever felt before
something about a kiss that 's gon na lead to more
something about a truck in a field and a girl in a red
sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
begging for another kiss
something about you and me and the birds and the bees
and lord have mercy it 's a beautiful thing
ai n't nothing about it luck , something about a truck
something about a creek around 2 am
after a few of those beers you wan na dive on in
you do n't need no clothes , just hang em on a limb
something about a creek around 2 am
something about a truck in a field and a girl in a red
sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
begging for another kiss
something about you and me and the birds and the bees
and lord have mercy it 's a beautiful thing
ai n't nothing about it luck , something about a truck
ai n't nothing about it luck , something about a truck

she grew up on the side of the road
where the church bells ring and strong love grows
she grew up good , she grew up slow
like american honey
steady as a preacher , free as a weed
could n't wait to get going but was n't quite ready to leave
so innocent , pure and sweet
american honey
there 's a wild , wild whisper blowin ' in the wind
callin ' out my name like a long lost friend
oh , i miss those days as the years go by
oh , nothin ' sweeter than summertime
and american honey
get caught in the race of this crazy life
tryin ' to be everything can make you lose your mind
i just wan na go back in time
to american honey
there 's a wild , wild whisper blowin ' in the wind
callin ' out my name like a long lost friend
oh , i miss those days as the years go by
oh , nothin ' sweeter than summertime
and american honey
gone for so long now
i got ta get back to her somehow
to american honey
there 's a wild , wild whisper blowin ' in the wind
callin ' out my name like a long lost friend
oh , i miss those days as the years go by
oh , nothin ' sweeter than summertime

yeah , it 's been a bumpy road
roller coasters high and low
fill the tank and drive the car
pedal fast , pedal hard
you wo n't have to go that far
you want to give up 'cause it 's dark
we 're really not that far apart
so let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you 're lost
and you should follow it wherever it may go
when it 's all said and done , you can walk instead of run
'cause no matter what , you 'll never be alone
never be alone
never be alone
do n't close your eyes do n't be afraid
we might be crazy late at night
i ca n't wait till you arrive
follow stars you 'll be alright
you want to give up 'cause it 's dark
we 're really not that far apart
so let your heart sweetheart be your compass when you 're lost
and you should follow it wherever it may go
when it 's all said and done , you can walk instead of run
'cause no matter what , you 'll never be alone
never be alone

well , all the parties on the streets are talking ,
we used to smoke while we were jaywalking like it
knew the bands so we never payed our cover .
wrote our names on the bathroom tiles .
we never dressed to impress all the others ,
they would let us in on a laid back kind of style .
but boy you know it 's been a while .
i do n't know why you do n't take me down town like you got anywhere better to be .
talk it up and give me the go round round like a good time tease .
i 'm only countin ' on your cancellation ,
then i should be countin ' on you at my door .
did you forget about how we went around ,
i do n't know why you do n't take me downtown anymore .
ohhhhhhhh anymore .
i got some platforms sitting in the corner .
they wan na stroll on a city sidewalk .
i got a dress that 'll show a little uhhh uh ,
but you ai n't getting uhh ohh if you do n't come pick me up -damn- ,
show me off -wow- , you might be tired but i 'm not !
and i do n't know why you do n't take me down town like you got anywhere better to be .
talk it up and give me the go round round like a good time tease .
i 'm only countin ' on your cancellation ,
then i should be countin ' on you at my door .
did you forget about how we went around ,

i run from hate
i run from prejudice
i run from pessimists
but i run too late
i run my life
or is it running me
run from my past
i run too fast
or too slow it seems
when lies become the truth
that ’ s when i run to you
this world keeps spinning faster
into a new disaster so i run to you
i run to you baby
and when it all starts coming undone
baby you ’ re the only one i run to
i run to you
we run on fumes
your life and mine
like the sands of time
slippin ’ right on through
and our love ’ s the only truth
that ’ s why i run to you
this world keeps spinning faster
into a new disaster so i run to you
i run to you baby
and when it all starts coming undone
baby you ’ re the only one i run to
i run to you
this world keeps spinning faster
into a new disaster so i run to you
i run to you baby
and when it all starts coming undone
baby you ’ re the only one i run to
i run to you
song over
lyin ' here with you so close to me
it 's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
caught up in this moment
caught up in your smile
i 've never opened up to anyone
so hard to hold back when i 'm holding you in my arms
we do n't need to rush this
let 's just take this slow
just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
just a touch in the fire burning so bright
and i do n't want to mess this thing up
i do n't want to push too far
just a shot in the dark that you just might
be the one i 've been waiting for my whole life
so baby i 'm alright , with just a kiss goodnight
i know that if we give this a little time
it will only bring us closer to the love we wan na find
it 's never felt so real , no it 's never felt so right
no i do n't want to say goodnight
i know it 's time to leave , but you 'll be in my dreams
tonight
tonight
tonight
just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
just a touch in the fire burning so bright
and i do n't want to mess this thing up
i do n't want to push too far
just a shot in the dark that you just might
be the one i 've been waiting for my whole life
so baby i 'm alright , oh , let 's do this right , with just a kiss goodnight
with a kiss goodnight
kiss goodnight

picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
reaching for the phone 'cause i ca n't fight it anymore
and i wonder if i ever cross your mind
for me it happens all the time
it 's a quarter after one , i 'm all alone and i need you now
said i would n't come , but i lost all control and i need you now
and i do n't know how i can do without , i just need you now
another shot of whiskey , ca n't stop looking at the door
wishing you 'd come sweeping in the way you did before
and i wonder if i ever cross your mind
for me it happens all the time
it 's a quarter after one , i 'm a little drunk and i need you now
said i would n't come , but i lost all control and i need you now
and i do n't know how i can do without , i just need you now

i wan na spend the rest of my life with you by my side
forever and ever
every little thing that you do
baby i 'm amazed by you .
the smell of your skin , the taste of your kiss
the way you whisper in the dark
your hair all around me , baby you surround me

when i got the news today
i did n't know what to say .
so i just hung up the phone .
i took a walk to clear my head ,
this is where the walking lead
ca n't believe you 're really gone
do n't feel like going home
so i 'm gon na sit right here
on the edge of this pier
watch the sunset disappear
and drink a beer
funny how the good ones go
too soon , but the good lord knows
the reasons why , i guess
sometimes the greater plan
is kinda hard to understand
right now it do n't make sense
i ca n't make it all make sense
so i 'm gon na sit right here
on the edge of this pier
watch the sunset disappear
and drink a beer
so long my friend
until we meet again
i 'll remember you
and all the times that we used to ...
... sit right here on the edge of this pier
and watch the sunset disappear
and drink a beer
drink a beer ,
drink a beer .

she was sittin ' all alone over on the tailgate , tan legs swingin ' by a
i was lookin ' for her boyfriend , thinkin ' , no way she ai n't got one
soon as i sat down i was fallin ' in love , tryin ' to pour a little sugar in her
dixie cup
talkin ' over the speakers in the back of that truck , she jumped up and cut me off
she was like , oh my god , this is my song , i 've been listenin ' to the radio
all night long
sittin ' 'round waitin ' for it to come on and here it is
she was like , come here boy , i wan na dance , 'fore i said a word , she was
takin ' my hand
spinnin ' me around 'til it faded out , and she gave me a kiss
and she said , play it again , play it again , play it again
and i said , play it again , play it again , play it again
i 'd have gave that dj my last dime , if he would have played it just one more time
but a little while later , we were sittin ' in the drive in my truck
before i walked her to the door , i was scannin ' like a fool am , fm , xm too
but i stopped real quick when i heard that groove , man , you should have seen
she was like , oh my god , this is my song , we 've been listenin ' to the radio
all night long
i ca n't believe it came back on , but here it is
she was like , come here boy , i wan na dance , 'fore i said a word , she was
takin ' my hand
spinnin ' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
and i said , play it again , play it again , play it again
and she said , play it again , play it again , play it again
the next friday night we were sittin ' out under the stars
you should have seen her smile when i brought out my guitar
she was like , oh my god , this is my song , i 've been listenin ' to the radio

sittin ' 'round waitin ' for it to come on and here it is

my daddy spent his life lookin ' up at the sky .
he 'd cuss , kick the dust , say this sun is way to dry .
if it clouds up in the city , the weather man complains .
but where i come from , rain is a good thing .
rain makes corn , corn makes whiskey .
back roads are cloggin ' up , my buddies pile up in my truck .
wehunt our hunny 's down , we 'll take all into town .
start washin ' all our worries down the drain .
rain is a good thing , rain is a good thing
ai n't nothin ' like a kiss out back in the barn .
ringin ' out our soakin ' clothes , ridin ' out a thunderstorm .
the tin roof gets to talkin ' ; it 's the best of what we made .
yea where i come from , rain is a good thing .
rain makes corn , corn makes whiskey .
whiskey makes my baby , feel a little frisky .
back roads are cloggin ' up , my buddies pile up in my truck .
wehunt our hunny 's down , we 'll take all into town .
start washin ' all our worries down the drain .
rain is a good thing , rain is a good thing
farmer johnson does a little dance .
creeks on the rise , well above your pants .
country girls , they wan na cuddle .
kids out playin ' in a big mud puddle .
rain makes corn , corn makes whiskey .
whiskey makes my baby , feel a little frisky .
back roads are cloggin ' up , my buddies pile up in my truck .
we hunt our hunny 's down , we 'll take all into town .
start washin ' all our worries down the drain .
rain is a good thing , rain is a good thing
rain is a good thing , rain is a good thing

out where the corn rows grow , row , row my boat
floatin ’ down the flint river , catch us up a little catfish dinner
gon na sound like a winner , when i lay you down and love you right
yeah , that ’ s my kind of night !
might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
put in my country rock hip-hop mixtape
little conway , a little t-pain , might just make it rain
you can hang your t-shirt on a limb
hit that bank and we can ease on in
soak us up a little moonlight
you know i know what you like , yeah !
all them other boys wan na wind you up and take you downtown
but you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
out where the corn rows grow , row , row my boat

i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
along with the sunshine there 's got ta be a little rain sometimes
when you take you got ta give so live and let live or let go oh oh oh oh
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
i could promise you things like big diamond rings
but you do n't find roses growing on a stalks of clover
so you better think it over
well it 's sweetin ' talkin ' you could make it come true
i would give you the world right now on a silver platter
but what would it matter
so smile for a while and lets be jolly
love should n't be so melancholy
come along and share the good times while we can..
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
along with the sunshine there 's got ta be a little rain sometimes
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
i could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
but if that 's what it takes to hold , i 'd just as soon let you go
but there 's one thing i want you to know
you better look before you leap , still waters run deep
and there wo n't always be someone there to pull you out
and ya know what i 'm talking about
so smile for a while and lets be jolly
love should n't be so melancholy
come along and share the good times while we can..
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
along with the sunshine there 's got ta be a little rain sometimes
i beg your pardon i never promised you a rose garden
along with the sunshine there 's got ta be a little rain sometimes
song over
ilsa was an acrobat who went and fell in love with that
horatio the human cannonball .
sideshow family oddities and all .
the dog-faced boy howled out with joy
as the tattooed lady was crying .
ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
it takes all kinds of kinds .
thomas was a congressman with closets full of skeletons
and dresses that he wore on friday nights .
phyllis was a pharmacist , a dab of that , a pinch of this
concocted to suppress her appetite .
when the children were fiddlin ' she 'd slip 'em some ritalin
and wait for thomasina to arrive .
cause ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
it takes all kinds of kinds . -all kinds of kinds-
all kinds of kinds .
when i play this old guitar from children 's shows to smoky bars
i take a break and think about the past .
when i stood up in geometry and everybody stared at me
and i tossed my test into the trash .
i scratched off my number while hitching out under
that bush league population sign .
ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
it takes all kinds of kinds .
now some point a finger and let ignorance linger
if they 'd look in the mirror they 'd find .
that ever since the beginning to keep the world spinning
it takes all kinds of kinds . -all kinds of kinds-
all kinds of kinds . -all kinds of kinds-
all kinds of kinds .

quarter in a payphone
watching sun tea in the window
pocket watch for telling time
seems like only yesterday
record the country countdown
'cos i could n't buy it yet
if we drove all the way to dallas
we 'd take along a rand mcnally
stand in line to pay for gas
god knows that shifting gears
i learned to drive that '55
just like a queen three on a tree
hey whatever happened to
waiting your turn
doing it all by hand
'cos when everything is handed to you
it 's only worth as much as the time you put in
it all just seems so good the way we had it
back before everything became , automatic
if you had something to say
and you 'd put a stamp on it
and they 'd get it three days later
boys would call the girls
staying married was the only way
to work your problems out
hey whatever happened to
waiting your turn
doing it all by hand
'cos when everything is handed to you
it 's only worth as much as the time you put in
it all just seems so good the way we had it
back before everything became , automatic , yeah
automatic
lets 's roll the windows down
come on let 's take a picture
the kind you got ta shake
hey whatever happened to
waiting your turn
doing it all by hand
'cos when everything is handed to you

i have been draggin ' around your sensitive ego
making sure that your bags arrive on time for the dog and pony show
a little suitcase like a brick ,
it kinda makes it hard to get a good grip
i drop your troubles off at the conveyor belt ,
i 'll hand you a ticket to go get it yourself
at the baggage claim , you got a lot of luggage in your name
when you hit the ground , check the lost and found
cause it ai n't my problem now
i ca n't carry it on , i 've got a lot of troubles on my own
it 's all over the yard , in the trunk of the car ,
i 'm packin ' it in , so come and get it .
if it ai n't obvious what has set me off today ,
behind every woman scorned is a man who made her that way
go on and take your little business trip with that sweet little habit that you ca n't kick
you better call your momma when you get to town
cause i ai n't gon na be hangin ' around
at the baggage claim , you got a lot of luggage in your name
when you hit the ground , check the lost and found
cause it ai n't my problem now
i ca n't carry it on , i 've got a lot of troubles on my own
it 's all over the yard , in the trunk of the car ,
i 'm packin ' it in , so come and get it .
come and pick it up , pick it up
before i blow it up in flames
you better pick it up , pick it up ,
baby , i 'm leaving everything ...
at the baggage claim , you got a lot of luggage in your name
when you hit the ground , check the lost and found
cause it ai n't my problem now

you got the bullets , i got the gun
i got a hankering for getting into something
i hit the bottle , you hit the gas
i heard your 65 could really haul some ass
i 'm feeling frisky , you 're feeling good
i guess the whiskey is doing what it should
i got the cigarettes , you got a lighter
and when the sun goes down we 'll start a little fire
ai n't no use in trying to slow me down
cause you 're running with the fastest girl in town
ai n't cha baby
i like em ' crazy
ai n't cha baby
i like em ' crazy
my reputation follows me around
just makes me wan na give em more to talk about
lets go to town for a little while
i 'll be wearing nothing but a tattoo and a smile
ai n't no use in trying to slow me down
cause you 're running with the fastest girl in town
ai n't cha baby
you 're kinda crazy
ai n't cha baby
you 're kinda crazy
i see the blue lights , we better run
throw out the bottle and i 'll hide the gun
if he pulls us over , i 'll turn on the charm
you 'll be in the slammer , and i 'll be on his arm
ai n't no use in trying to slow me down
cause you 're running with the fastest girl in town

i ai n't the kind you take home to mama
i ai n't the kind to wear no ring
somehow i always get stronger
when i 'm on my second drink
even though i hate to admit it
sometimes i smoke cigarettes
the christian folk say i should quit it
i just smile and say , 'god bless '
cause i heard jesus , he drank wine
and i bet we 'd get along just fine
he could calm a storm and heal the blind
and i bet he 'd understand a heart like mine
daddy cried when he saw my tattoo
said he loved me anyway
my brother got the brains of the family
so i thought i 'd learn to sing
cause i heard jesus , he drank wine
and i bet we 'd get along just fine
he could calm a storm and heal the blind
and i bet he 'd understand a heart like mine
well , i 'll flyyyy , awaay
from it all ... .. one day
and i 'll flyyy ... ... .. away ,
but these are the days that i will remember
when my name 's called on the roll
he 'll meet me with two long-stemmed glasses
and make a toast to me coming home
cause i heard jesus , he drank wine
and i bet we 'd get along just fine
he could calm a storm and heal the blind
and i bet he 'd understand a heart like mine

i ’ m waitin ’ on the sun to set
cause yesterday aint over yet
i started smoking cigarettes there ’ s
nothing else to do i guess
dusty roads aint made for walking ,
spinning tires aint made for stoppin ’
i ’ m giving up on love cause love ’ s
given up on me
well i gave it everything i had and
everything i got was bad
life aint hard but it ’ s too long to
live it like some country song
trade the truth in for a lie , cheating
really aint a crime
i ’ m giving up on love cause love ’ s
given up on me
forget your high society , i ’ m soakin ’ it
in kerosene
light ‘ em up and watch them burn , teach
them what they need to learn ha !
dirty hands aint made for shakin ’ , aint
a rule that aint worth breakin ’
well i ’ m giving up on love cause
love ’ s given up on me
now i don ’ t hate the one who left
you ca n't hate someone whos dead
he ’ s out there holding on to someone ,
i ’ m holding up my smoking gun
i ’ ll find somewhere to lay my blame the
day she changes her last name
well i ’ m giving up on love cause love ’ s
given up on me
well i ’ m giving up on love hey love ’ s given
up on me
song over
i cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
i screamed his named till the neighbors called the cops
i numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
do n't know what i did next all i know i could n't stop
word got around to the barflies and the baptist
my mama 's phone started ringing off the hook
i can hear her now saying she ai n't gon na have it
do n't matter how you feel it only matters how you look
go and fix your make up girl its just a break up
run and hide your crazy and start acting like a lady
'cause i raised you better got ta keep it together
even when you fall apart , well , this ai n't my mama 's broken heart
wish i could be just a little less dramatic
like a kennedy when camelot went down in flames
leave it to me to be holding the matches
when the fire trucks show up and there 's nobody else to blame
ca n't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
sometimes revenge is a choice you got a make
my mama came from a softer generation
when you get a grip and bite your lip just to save her little face
go and fix your make up girl its just a break up
run and hide your crazy and start acting like a lady
'cause i raised you better got ta keep it together
even when you fall apart , well , this ai n't my mama 's broken heart
powder your nose , paint your toes , line your lips and keep them closed
go and fix your make up girl its just a break up
run and hide your crazy and start acting like a lady
'cause i raised you better got ta keep it together
even when you fall apart , well , this ai n't my mama 's broken heart

i know they say , you ca n't go home again
i just had to come back one last time
ma'am i know , you do n't know me from adam
but these handprints on the front steps are mine
up those stairs , in that little back bedroom
is where i did my homework and i learned to play guitar
and i bet you did n't know , under that live oak
my favorite dog is buried in the yard
i thought if i could touch this place , or feel it
this brokenness inside me might start healin '
out here it 's like i 'm someone else ,
i thought that maybe i could find myself
if i could just come in i swear i 'll leave
wo n't take nothin ' but a memory
from the house that ... built me
mama cut out pictures of houses for years
from `` better homes and garden '' magazine
plans were drawn and concrete poured and
nail by nail and board by board
daddy gave life to mama 's dream
i thought if i could touch this place , or feel it
this brokenness inside me might start healin '
out here it 's like i 'm someone else ,
i thought that maybe i could find myself
if i could just come in i swear i 'll leave
wo n't take nothin ' but a memory
from the house that ... built me
you leave home and you move on and you do the best you can
i got lost in this old world and forgot , who i am
i thought if i could touch this place or feel it
this brokenness inside me might start healing
out here it 's like i 'm someone else
i thought that maybe i could find myself
if i could walk around i swear i 'll leave
wo n't take nothin ' but a memory
from the house that ... . built me

home is where my heart is still beating
i do n't know when i 'll see her again
i hate to see her cry when i 'm leaving
but now i 'm a thousand miles away again
she feels like carolina
looks like california
shining like those new york lights on broadway
when she looks back i 'm behind her
i 'll always be there for her
she makes me feel like home 's not so far away
she feels like carolina
it 's hard to understand the way i 'm living
i know you think i 'm never coming home
but i miss your pretty smile , and i 'm coming back in a little while
but i 'm a thousand miles away again
she feels like carolina
looks like california
shining like those new york lights on broadway
when she looks back i 'm behind her
i 'll always be there for her
she makes me feel like home 's not so far away
she feels like carolina
she makes me feel like home 's not so far away
no matter how far i go
you know i ca n't stop thinking about her
and there 's nothing like the way i feel
the way i feel when i 'm beside her
oh oh , oh oh , oh oh
oh oh , oh oh , oh oh
she feels like carolina
looks like california
shining like those new york lights on broadway

song over
my brother got out of rehab
right around christmas time
daddy was worried he was gon na have to break up a fight
everybody was walking on eggshells
drinking eggnog instead of beer
we were holding our tongues scratching our heads
wondering how the hell we got here
hush hush do n't you dare say a word
hush hush do n't you know the truth hurts
hush hush when push comes to shove
it 's best to keep it hush hush
we were sitting around the dinner table
and we were eating our pumpkin pie
pretty little secret was eating everybody alive
well daddy 's reading propaganda
and he 's talking about the end of days
well cheers to the vodka mama 's been sneaking
let 's all gather around and pray
hush hush do n't you dare say a word
hush hush do n't you know the truth hurts
hush hush when push comes to shove
it 's best to keep it hush hush
so i snuck at behind the red barn
and i took myself a toke
hell i might as well be the joke
i 'm gon na dance up on the table
singing this little light of mine
god gave it to me what good 's it gon na do me
if i do n't by god let it shine
hush hush do n't you dare say a word
hush hush do n't you know the truth hurts
hush hush when push comes to shove
it 's best to keep it hush hush
hide your tattoo
put on your sunday best
be the happy family in the front pew
hush hush do n't you dare say a word
hush hush do n't you know the truth hurts
hush hush when push comes to shove
it 's best to keep it hush hush
do n't you dare say a word
hush hush do n't you know the truth hurts
hush hush when push comes to shove
it 's best to keep it hush hush

let 's start it with a long goodbye , get wrapped up tight
let 's spend all night right here

i came up out of the water
raised my hands up to the father
gave it all to him that day
felt a new wind kiss my face
walked away eyes wide open
could finally see where i was going
it did n't matter where i 'd been
i 'm not the same way i was then
i got off track i made mistakes
where souls get lost , lines get crossed
i hit my knees now here i stand
there i was now here i am
here i am , ...
changed
i got a lot of `` hey i 'm sorry 's ''
for things i 've done , man that was not me
i wish i could take it all back
i just want to tell 'em that
tell 'em that
i got off track i made mistakes
where souls get lost , lines get crossed
i hit my knees now here i stand
there i was now here i am
here i am , ...
changed
i 'm changed for the better
for smiles that 's bitter
i 'm even starting to forgive myself
yes i am

there i was now here i am
here i am , ... here i am
i 'm changed yes i am
im changed for the better
thank god i 'm changed

sometimes it feels like this world is spinning faster
than it did in the old days
so naturally we have more natural disasters
from the strain of a fast pace
sunday was the day of rest
now its one more day for progress
and we ca n't slow down
cause more is best
it 's all an endless process
well i miss mayberry
sitting on the porch drinking ice cold cherry -- - coke
where everything is black & white
picking on a six string
where people pass by and you call them by their first name
watching the clouds roll by
bye bye
well i miss mayberry
sitting on the porch drinking ice cold cherry -- - coke
where everything is black & white
picking on a six string
where people pass by and you call them by their first name
watching the clouds roll by

sometimes i dream i 'm driving down an old dirt road
not even listed on the map
i pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole
but i always wake up everytime i try to turn back
well i miss mayberry
sitting on the porch drinking ice cold cherry -- - coke
where everything is black & white
picking on a six string

i can take the rain on the roof of this empty house ,
that do n't bother me ,
i can take a few tears now and then and just let em out ,
i 'm not afraid to cry every once in awhile ,
even though goin on with you gone , still upsets me ,
there are days every now and again , i pretend i 'm ok ,
but that 's a not what gets me
what hurts the most , was being so close ,
and having so much to say , and watching you walk away ,
and never knowin ' , what could 've been ,
and not seein that lovin you , is what i was tryin to do
it 's hard to deal with the pain of losin you everywhere i go ,
but i 'm doin ' it ,
it 's hard to force that smile when i see our old friends and i 'm alone ,
still harder ,
gettin up , gettin dressed , livin with this regret ,
but i know if i could do it over , i would trade , give away
all the words that i saved in my heart that i left unspoken
what hurts the most , is being so close ,
and having so much to say , and watching you walk away ,
and never knowin ' , what could 've been ,
and not seein that lovin you , is what i was tryin to do

holding you so tight under that porch light
but girl i got ta see you tonight , tonight , tonight
girl i got ta see you tonight , tonight , tonight , yeah

i just got ta get a little moonlight kiss
girl i ca n't help it when i feel like this
there 's only one thing to do
baby i 'm missing you
so i 'm coming over , i hope it 's allright
listen for me pulling into your drive
look out your window , you 'll see my lights
baby girl i got ta see you tonight
the way the breeze is blowing , blowing
got me wishing i was holding , holding
holding you so tight under that porch light
but girl i got ta see you tonight , tonight , tonight
girl i got ta see you tonight , tonight , tonight , yeah
song over
i walked to the door with you , the air was cold
but something about it felt like home somehow , and i ,
left my scarf there at your sisters house
and you still got it , in your drawer , even now
oh your sweet dispositon and my wide eyed gaze
we 're singing in the car getting lost upstate
the autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days
and i know it 's long gone and , and magics not here no more
and i might be okay but i 'm not fine at all
cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red cause you were lookin ' over at me
wind in my hair , i was there , i remember it all too well
photo album on the counter your cheeks were turing red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed
and your mothers telling stories 'bout you on a t-ball team
you tell me about your past thinkin ' your future was me
and i know it 's long gone and it was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed too
cause here we are again in the middle of the night
we dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs , i was there , i remember it all too well
and maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
running scared , i was there , i remember it all too well
hey you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
i 'm a crumpled up piece of paper lyin ' here
cause i remember it all all all too well
time wo n't fly it 's like i 'm paralyzed by it
i 'd like to be my old self again but i 'm still tryin ' to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you cant get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah
cause there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you 've ever known
it was rare , i was there , i remember it all too well
wind in my hair , you were there , you remember it oh
down the stairs , you were there , you remember it all
it was rare , i was there , i remember it all too well
song over
i 'm so glad you made the time to see me
how 's life , tell me how 's your family
i have n't seen them in a while
you 've been good , busier than ever
we small talk , work and the weather
you 're guard is up , and i know why
because the last time you saw me
it 's still burned in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and i left them there to die
so this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying
`` i 'm sorry for that night '' and i go
back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ai n't
nothing but missing you
wishing i 'd realized what i had
when you were mine
i 'd go back to december ,
turn around and make it all right
i go back to december all the time
these days i have n't been sleeping
stayin ' up playing back myself leaving
when your birthday passed and i did n't call
then i think about summer all the beautiful times
i watch you laughing from the passenger side
and realized i loved you in the fall
and then the cold came the dark days
when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and
all i gave you was goodbye
so this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying
`` i 'm sorry for that night '' and i go
back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ai n't
nothing but missing you
wishing i 'd realized what i had
when you were mine
i 'd go back to december ,
turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
i miss your tan skin your sweet smile
so good to me , so right
and how you held me in your arms
that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinking
probably mindless dreaming
if you loved again i swear i 'd love you right
i 'd go back in time and change it but i ca n't
so if the chain is on your door i understand
but this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying
`` i 'm sorry for that night '' and i go
back to december ...
it turns out freedom ai n't
nothing but missing you
wishing i 'd realized what i had
when you were mine
i 'd go back to december
turn around and make it all right
i 'd go back to december
turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
all the time
song over
took a deep breath in the mirror he did n't like it when i wore high heels
but i do
turn the lock and put my headphones on he always said he did n't get this song
but i do - mute - i do
walked in expecting you 'd be late but you got here early and you stand and wave
i walk to you
you pull my chair out and help me in and you do n't now how nice that is
but i do
and you throw your head back laughin ' like a , little kid
i think it 's strange that you think i 'm funny cause ,
he never did
and i 've been spending the last eight months
thinkin ' all love ever does is
break , burn , and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe - mute - i watched it begin again
he said he never met one girl who had as many james taylor records as you
but i do
we tell stories and you dont know why you 're comin ' off a little shy
but i do
but you throw your head back laughin ' like a , little kid
i think it 's strange that you think i 'm funny cause ,
he never did
and i 've been spending the last eight months
thinkin ' all love ever does is
break , burn , and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
and we walk down the block to my car and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about the movies
that your family watches , every single christmas
and i will talk about that
and for the first time , what 's past is past
cause you throw your head back laughin ' like a , little kid
i think it 's strange that you think i 'm funny cause ,
he never did
and i 've been spending the last eight months
thinkin ' all love ever does is
break , burn , and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe
i watched it begin again
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
song over
everybody 's waiting
everybody 's watching
even when you 're sleepin '
keep your ey-eyes open
the tricky thing
is yesterday we were just , children
playing soldiers just pre-tending
dreaming dreams with happy endings
in backyards ,
winning battles with the , wooden swords
but now we 've stepped into a , cruel world
where everybody stands and , keeps score
keep your eyes open
everybody 's waiting for you to breakdown
everybody 's watching to see the fallout
even when you 're sleepin ' , sleepin '
keep your ey-eyes open
keep your ey-eyes open
keep your ey-eyes open
so here you are
two steps ahead and staying , on guard
every lesson forms a , new scar
they never thought you 'd make it , this far
but turn around
oh , they surrounded you , it 's , a showdown
and nobody comes to save you now
but you got something they do n't
you just got ta keep your eyes open
everybody 's waiting for you to breakdown
everybody 's watching to see the fallout
even when you 're sleepin ' , sleepin '
keep your ey-eyes open
keep your ey-eyes open
keep your ey-eyes
keep your feet ready
heartbeat steady
keep your ey-eyes open
keep your aim locked
the night grows dark
ke-ep your ey-eyes open
keep your ey-eyes open
keep your ey-eyes open
keep your ey-eyes open
keep your ey-eyes open
everybody 's waiting for you to breakdown
everybody 's watching to see the fallout
even when you 're sleepin ' , sleepin '
keep your ey-eyes open
- keep your ey-eyes open -
keep your ey-eyes open
- keep your ey-eyes open -
keep your ey-eyes open
song over
there 's something 'bout the way
the streets looked when it ’ s just rained
there 's a glow off the pavement
walk me to the car
and you know i wan na ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot
yeah oh yeah
we 're drivin ' down the road
i wonder if you know
i 'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
but you 're just so cool
run your hands through your hair
absent-mindedly making me want you
and i do n't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first , fearless
and i do n't know why but with you i 'd dance
in a storm in my best dress , fearless
so baby drive slow till we run out of road
in this one horse town
i wan na stay right here in this passenger seat
you put your eyes on me
in this moment now capture it remember it
cause i do n't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first , fearless
and i do n't know why but with you i 'd dance
in a storm in my best dress , fearless
yea you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake & im not usually this way
but you pull me in & im a little more brave
it 's a first kiss , it 's flawless , really something
it 's fearless
ohh.. yeah
and i do n't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first , fearless
and i do n't know why but with you i 'd dance
in a storm in my best dress , fearless
yeah i do n't know how
oh.. oh , yeah , yeah
song over
you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
its the morning of your very first day
you say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
try and stay out of everybodys way
it 's your freshman year and you 're gon na be here
for the next four years in this town
hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
you know i have n't seen you around , before
'cause when you 're fifteen and
somebody tells you they love you
you 're gon na believe them
and when you 're fifteen
feeling like there 's nothing to figure out
well count to ten , take it in
this is life before you know who you 're gon na be
at fifteen
you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough you 're best friends
laughing at the other girls who think they 're so cool
we 'll be out of here as soon as we can
and then you 're on your very first date
and he 's got a car and you 're feeling like flying
and you 're momma 's waiting up and you 're thinking he 's the one
and you 're dancing round your room when the night ends
when the night ends
'cause when you 're fifteen and
somebody tells you they love you
you 're gon na believe them
and when you 're fifteen
and your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
but in your life you 'll do things greater than
dating the boy on the football team
but i didnt know it at fifteen
when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then i swore i was gon na marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had to a boy
who changed his mind and we both cried
'cause when you 're fifteen and
somebody tells you they love you
you 're gon na believe them
and when you 're fifteen
do n't forget to look before you fall
i 've found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you 're supposed to be
i did n't know who i was supposed to be
at fifteen
la la la la la
la la la la la
your very first day , take a deep breath girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
song over
i was reminiscing just the other day
back to a first-glance feeling on new york time
took off fast through the green light go
i left a note on the door with a joke we 'd made
and that was the first day
and darling it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground
spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
we blocked the noise with the sound of i need you
well i guess we fell apart in the usual way
sometimes i wonder how you think about it now
and i see your face in every crowd
and darling it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground
tonight i 'm gon na dance for all that we 've been through
tonight i 'm gon na dance like you were in this room
but i do n't wan na dance if i 'm not dancing with you
it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground
tonight i 'm gon na dance for all that we 've been through
but i do n't wan na dance if i 'm not dancing with you
tonight i 'm gon na dance like you were in this room
but i do n't wan na dance if i 'm not dancing with you
song over
i bet this time of night you 're still up
i bet you 're tired from a long , hard week
i bet you 're sitting in your chair by the window
looking out at the city
and i bet sometimes you wonder about me
and i just want to tell you
it takes everything in me , not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i do n't
i almost do ,
i almost dooooo
i bet you think i either moved on or hate you
'cause each time you reach out there 's no reply
i bet it never , ever , occurred to you
that i ca n't say hello to you
and risk another goodbye
and i just want to tell you
it takes everything in me , not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i do n't
i almost do ,
i almost doooo
we made quite a mess , babe
it 's probably better off this way and i confess , babe
that in my dreams you 're touching my face
and asking me if i want to try again with you
and i almost do
and i just want to tell you
it takes everything in me , not to call you
and i wish i could run to you
and i hope you know that
every time i do n't
i almost do ,
i almost doooo
i bet this time of night you 're still up
i bet you 're tired from a long , hard week
i bet you 're sitting in your chair by the window
looking out at the city
and i hope , sometimes you wonder about me
song over
would you walk to the edge of the ocean
just to fill my jar w/ sand
just in case i got the notion
to let it run through my hand , let it run through my hand ?
well , i do n't want the whole world ,
the sun , the moon , and all their lights .
i just wan na be the only girl
you love all your li -- -- -fe . oh you love all your li -- -- -fe .
would you catch a couple thousand fireflies ,
put 'em in a lamp to light my world ,
all dresses up in a tux and bow tie
hand delivered to a lonely girl , to a lonely , lonely girl ?
well , i do n't want the whole world ,
the sun , the moon , and all their lights .
i just wan na be the only girl
you love all your li -- -- -fe . oh you love all your li -- -- -fe .
lately i 've been writing desperate love songs .
i mostly sing them to the wall , hey hey .
you could be the centerpiece of my obsession
if you would notice me at all yeah yeah yeah
well , i do n't want the whole world no
the sun , the moon , and all their lights
i just wan na be the only girl
you love all your li -- -- fe , li -- -- fe , li -- -- fe . x2
you love all your li -- -- fe , li -- -- fe , yeeeaahh .
song over
i told you on the day we wed
i was gon na love you til i 's dead
made you wait til our wedding night
that 's the first and the last time i wear white
so if the ties that bind ever do come loose ,
tie 'em in a knot like a hangman 's noose
cuz i 'll go to heaven or i 'll go to hell
- no chord - and let the stone say
hear lies a girl whose only crutch
was lovin ' one man just a little too much
if you go before i do ,
i 'm gon na tell the gravedigger that he 'd better dig two
well , it wo n't be whiskey , it wo n't be meth
it 'll be his name on my last breath
if divorce will dare ever do us part ,
- no chord - and let the stone say
hear lies a girl whose only crutch
was lovin ' one man just a little too much
if you go before i do ,
i 'm gon na tell the gravedigger that he 'd better dig two
dig two ohhh ohhh
i took your name when i took those vows - took those vows -
i meant 'em back then and i mean 'em right now , oh right now
if the ties that bind ever do come loose ,
if forever ever ends for you ,
if that ring gets a little two tight ,
you might as well read me my last rights - no chord - and let the stone say
hear lies a girl whose only crutch
was lovin ' one man just a little too much
if you go before i do ,
i 'm gon na tell the gravedigger that he 'd better dig two
put his stone right next to mine
we 'll be together til the end of time
do n't you go before i do
i 'm gon na tell the gravedigger that he 'd better dig two
i told you on the day we wed
i was gon na love you til i 's dead
song over
i need a saving grace
a hiding place
i do n't have forever or time to waste
so do n't let me be lonely
i wan na shake this winter coat off my sleeve
dust off a record and just be free
oh do n't let me be lonely
no do n't let me be lonely
when you 're young
you can fly
but we trip on clouds 'cause we get too high
we grow up
and then it 's gone
oh god only knows what we 'll become
so do n't let me be , let me be , let me be lonely tonight
while we 're young and alive
take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
oh do n't let me , let me be lonely
well the night rolls on like a long lost friend
'til the sunrise bleeds like the bitter end
do n't let me be lonely
well there 's nothing to hide and nothing to prove
give me all that you are
you 've got nothing to lose
just do n't let me be lonely
no do n't let me be lonely
so do n't let me be , let me be , let me be lonely tonight
while we 're young and alive
take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
oh do n't let me , let me be lonely
when you 're young
life 's a dream
it 's a beautiful and a burning thing
we grow up
and then it 's gone
so do n't let me be , let me be , let me be lonely tonight
while we 're young and alive
take the keys to my car and the keys to my heart and just drive
oh do n't let me , let me be lonely
song over
if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song
oh oh , oh oh
lord make me a rainbow , i 'll shine down on my mother
she 'll know i 'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
oh and life ai n't always what you think it ought to be
no , ai n't even grey , but she buries her baby
the sharp knife of a short life
well , i 've had just enough time
if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song
the sharp knife of a short life
well , i 've had just enough time
and i 'll be wearing white when i come into your kingdom
i 'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
i 've never known the loving of a man
but it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
there 's a boy here in town says he 'll love me forever
who would have thought forever could be severed by
the sharp knife of a short life
well , i 've had just enough time
so put on your best boys
and i 'll wear my pearls
what i never did is done
oh no , i 'll sell them for a dollar
they 're worth so much more after i 'm a goner
and maybe then you 'll hear the words i 've been singing
funny when you 're dead how people start listening
if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song
oh oh , the ballad of a dove
go in peace and love
gather up your tears
keep them in your pocket
save them for a time when you 're really gon na need them .
oh oh , the sharp knife of a short life
well , i 've had just enough time
so put on your best boys
and i 'll wear my pearls
song over
sometimes it feels like , im gon na break
sometimes this world , gives more than i can take
sometimes , sunshine gets lost in the rain
and it keeps pouring down
it just keeps coming down .
this life would kill me if i didnt have you
i couldnt live without you baby
i wouldnt want to
if you didnt love me so much
id never make it through
cuz this life would kill me
this life would kill me if i didnt have you .
you are my heart , every breath i breathe
im safe in your arms , you rescue me .
when im weak , youre strong
if you were gone i dont know where id be
you were made for me -you were made for me-
this life would kill me if i didnt have you
i couldnt live without you baby
i wouldnt want to
if you didnt love me so much
id never make it through
cuz this life would kill me
this life would kill me if i didnt have-
you
if you didnt love me so much -if you didnt love me so much-
this life would kill me if i didnt have you -this life would kill me-
couldnt live without you baby
i wouldnt want to
if you didnt love me so much
id never make it through
cuz this life would kill me
this life would kill me if i didnt have you

if you 're reading this my momma 's sittin there . looks like i only got a one
way ticket over here . sure wish i could give you one more kiss . war was
just a game we played when we were kids . so i 'm laying down my gun , and
hangin up my boots . im up here with god and were both watching over you .
so lay me down , in that open field out on the edge of town .
and know my soul , is where my momma always prayed that it would go .
if you 're reading this , i 'm already home .
if you 're reading this , halfway round the world , i wont be there
to see the birth of our little girl . i hope she looks like you , i hope she
fights like me . and stands up for the innocent and
the weak . so i 'm laying down my gun , and hangin up my boots . tell dad i
don ’ t regret that i followed in his shoes .
so lay me down , in that open field out on the edge of town .
and know my soul , is where my momma always prayed that it would go .
if you 're reading this , i 'm already home .
if you 're reading this there 's gon na come a day , when you 'll move
on and find someone else , and that 's okay . just remember this , i 'm in a

angels sing `` amazing grace ''

now i ai n't sayin ' them la ladies do n't know what they 're doin '
and i been in love with new york city a time or two
i had some seattle coffee , some chicago wind
some kansas sweet fields i 'd love to see again
but the fireflies play where the cattails grow
and them southern girls , they talk nice and slow with
kisses sweeter than tupelo honey
little bit crazy like new orleans
memphis blue and daytona sunny
soft as cotton in some cut-off jeans
do n't you know ,
ai n't nothing in the whole wide world , like a southern girl
southern girl rock my world , hazel eyes and golden curls
put on a country song , gon na dance all night long
a southern girl 's mama probably taught her how a lady should act
but a southern girl 's probably got a barn somewhere reared out back
she 'll get a little hay in her hair , her thighs in the mud
she 's been caught in the rain , and washed in the blood
likes jiggers in her coke , takes a little sip ,
comes over to me with them sunburned lips and them
kisses sweeter than tupelo honey
little bit crazy like new orleans
memphis blue and daytona sunny
soft as cotton in some cut-off jeans
do n't you know ,
ai n't nothing in the whole wide world , like a southern girl
southern girl rock my world , hazel eyes and golden curls
put on a country song , gon na dance all night long
well then fellows come on , you know what i 'm talkin ' about
kisses sweeter than tupelo honey
little bit crazy like new orleans
memphis blue and daytona sunny
soft as cotton in some cut-off jeans
do n't you know ,
ai n't nothing in the whole wide world , like a southern girl
southern girl rock my world
put on a country song
southern girl rock my world , hazel eyes and golden curls
and dance all night long
southern girl rock my world , hazel eyes and golden curls
put on a country song , we 'll dance all night long
southern girl rock my world , hazel eyes and golden curls
put on a country song , we 'll dance all night long
southern girl rock my world , hazel eyes and golden curls
put on a country song , we 'll dance all night long

freddy mac can kiss my ass
let 's have a party
let 's have a party
proceed to party
proceed to party
now , i really love how you 're easy to stack
'cause when beer runs down in front of my pack
well , that , my friends , is quite yucky
but i have to admit that the ladies get smitten
on you with a sharpie when i get to hittin '
when i get to hittin ' on them to help me get lucky
let 's have a party
let 's have a party
proceed to party

and believe me that i am not the least bit sarcastic

song over
i was there in the winter of '64 , camped in the ice at nashville 's door .
three-hundred miles our trail had led , we barely had time to bury our dead .
when the yankees charged and the colors fell , overton hill was a living hell .
when we called retreat it was almost dark ,
i died with a grape-shot in my heart .
say a prayer for peace , for every fallen son .
set my spirit free , let me lay down my gun .
sweet mother mary , i 'm so tired ,
but i ca n't come home til the last shot 's fired .
in june of 1944 , i waded in the blood of omaha 's shore .
twenty-one and scared to death , my heart poundin ' in my chest .
i almost made the first sea wall , when my friends turned and saw me fall .
i still smell the smoke , i can taste the mud ,
as i lay there dying from a loss of blood .
say a prayer for peace , for every fallen son .
set my spirit free , let me lay down my gun .
sweet mother mary , i 'm so tired ,
but i ca n't come home til the last shot 's fired .
i 'm in the fields of vietnam , the mountains of afghanistan ,
and i 'm still hopin ' , waitin ' , prayin ' i did not die in vain .
say a prayer for peace , for every fallen son .
set our spirits free , let us lay down our guns .
sweet mother mary , we 're so tired ,
but we ca n't come home til the last shot 's fired .
til the last shot 's fired .
song over
you know i like my chicken fried
a cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well , i was raised up
beneath the shade of a georgia pine
and that 's home you know
sweet tea , pecan pie and homemade wine
where the peaches grow
and my house it 's not much to talk about
but it 's filled with love
that 's grown in southern ground
and a little bit of chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well , i 've seen the sunrise
see the love in my woman 's eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother 's love
it 's funny how it 's the little things in life
that mean the most
not where you live or what you drive
or the price tag on your clothes
there 's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
this i 've come to know
so if you agree , have a drink with me
raise your glasses for a toast
to a little bit of chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well , i 've seen the sunrise
see the love in my woman 's eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother 's love
i thank god for my life
and for the stars and stripes
may freedom forever fly
let it ring
salute the ones who died
the ones that give their lives
so we do n't have to sacrifice
all the things we love
like our chicken fried
and cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well , i 've seen the sunrise
see the love in my woman 's eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother 's love
yes , a little chicken fried
cold beer on a friday night
a pair of jeans that fit just right
and the radio up
well , i 've seen the sunrise
see the love in my woman 's eyes
feel the touch of a precious child
and know a mother 's love
song over
she 'd trade colorado if he 'd take her with him
closes the door before the winter lets the cold in ,
and wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay ,
she 's answered by the tail lights
shining through the window pane
he said i wan na see you again
but i 'm stuck in colder weather
maybe tomorrow will be better
can i call you then
she said you 're ramblin ' man
you ai n't ever gon na change
you got ta gypsy soul to blame
and you were born for leavin '
at a truck stop diner just outside of lincoln ,
the night is black as the coffee he was drinkin ' ,
and in the waitress ' eyes he sees the same 'ol light shinin ' ,
he thinks of colorado
and the girl he left behind him
he said i wan na see you again
but i 'm stuck in colder weather
maybe tomorrow will be better
can i call you then
she said you 're ramblin ' man
you ai n't ever gon na change
you got ta gypsy soul to blame
and you were born for leavin ' - born for leavin ' -
well it 's a winding road
when your in the lost and found
you 're a lover i 'm a runner
we go 'round ' n 'round
and i love you but i leave you
i do n't want you but i need you
you know it 's you who calls me back here babe
oh i wan na see you again
but i 'm stuck in colder weather
maybe tomorrow will be better
can i call you then
cuz i 'm a ramblin ' man
i ai n't ever gon na change
i got ta gypsy soul to blame
and i was born for leavin '
i can smell your perfume through these whispering pines
i 'm with your ghost again
it 's a shame about the weather
i know soon we 'll be together
and i ca n't wait till then
i ca n't wait till then
song over
i been burning bright so long i ca n't remember
pretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of work
believe me when i say , i ca n't stay this high forever
this man 's had all he can stand , time to lay this body downai
sweet annie , can i stay with you a while
cause this roads been putting miles on my heart
sweetheart i 've been livin in a fantasy but one day lightning will strike
and my bark will lose its bite but dont give up on me sweet annie
sweet annie , can i stay with you a while
cause this roads been putting miles on my heart
sweetheart i 've been livin in a fantasy but one day lightning will strike
and my bark will lose its bite but dont give up on me sweet annie
turn out the light these hands alone to hold you
fall all over you all over again
come a little closer so i can show you
my heart still beats fast for you
all over and over again
sweet annie , can i stay with you a while
cause this roads been putting miles on my heart
sweetheart i 've been livin in a fantasy but one day lightning will strike
and my bark will lose its bite but dont give up on me sweet annie
song over
i got my toes in the water ,
ass in the sand
not a worry in the world
a cold beer in my hand
life is good today
life is good today
well the plane touched town
just about 3 o'clock
and the city 's still on my mind
bikinis & palm trees danced in my head
i was still in the baggage line
concrete and cars are their own prison bars
like this life i 'm livin in
but the plane brought me farther
i 'm surrounded by water
and i 'm not going back again
i got my toes in the water ,
ass in the sand
not a worry in the world
a cold beer in my hand
life is good today
life is good today
adios and vaya con dios
yea , i 'm leavin ga
and if it were n't for tequila & pretty senoritas
adios and vaya con dios
yea , i 'm leavin ga
gon na lay in the hot sun
& grab my guitar & play
the 4 days flew by
like a drunk friday night
as the summer drew to an end
they ca n't believe that i just could n't leave
and i bid adeiu to my friends
cuz my bartender
she 's from the islands
her body 's been kissed by the sun
& coconut replaces the smell of the bar
& i do n't know if its her or the rum
i got my toes in the water ,
ass in the sand
not a worry in the world
a cold beer in my hand
life is good today
life is good today
adios and vaya con dios
a long way from ga
hey and all the muchas they call me big papa
when i throw pesos their way
adios and vaya con dios
a long way from ga
hey boss do me a favor
& i 'll grab my guitar & play
adios and vaya con dios
goin home now to stay
cuz senioritas do n't care-oh
you got no money to stay
adios and vaya con dios
goin home now to stay
with my ass in the lawn chair
toes in the clay
not a worry in the world
a p-b-r on the way
life is good today
life is good today
