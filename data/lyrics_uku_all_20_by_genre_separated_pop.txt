there 's a fire starting in my heart ,
reaching a fever pitch and it 's bringing me out the dark
finally , i can see you crystal clear .
go ahead and sell me out and i 'll lay your ship bare .
see how i leave , with every piece of you
do n't underestimate the things that i will do .
there 's a fire starting in my heart ,
reaching a fever pitch and it 's bringing me out the dark
the scars of your love , remind me of us .
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
the scars of your love , they leave me breathless
i ca n't help feeling ...
we could have had it all ... - i wish you , never had met me - ...
rolling in the deep - tears are gon na fall , rolling in the deep -
your had my heart ... - i wish you - ... inside of your hand - never had met me -
and you played it ... - tears are gon na fall - ... to the beat - rolling in the deep -
baby i have no story to be told ,
but i 've heard one of you and i 'm gon na make your head burn .
think of me in the depths of your despair .
making a home down there , as mine sure wo n't be shared .
the scars of your love , remind me of us .
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
the scars of your love , they leave me breathless
i ca n't help feeling ...

song over
i let it fall , my heart ,
and as it fell , you rose to claim it ,
it was dark and i was over ,
until you kissed my lips and you saved me ,
my hands , they 're strong ,
but my knees were far too weak ,
to stand in your arms
without falling to your feet ,
but there 's a side to you that i never knew , never knew ,
all the things you 'd say , they were never true , never true ,
and the games you 'd play , you would always win , always win ,
but i set fire to the rain ,
watched it pour as i touched your face ,
well , it burned while i cried ,
'cause i heard it screaming out your name , your name ,
when lay with you
i could stay there , close my eyes ,
feel you here forever ,
you and me together , nothing is better ,
but there 's a side to you that i never knew , never knew ,
all the things you 'd say , they were never true , never true ,
and the games you 'd play , you would always win , always win ,
but i set fire to the rain ,
watched it pour as i touched your face ,
well , it burned while i cried ,
'cause i heard it screaming out your name , your name ,
i set fire to the rain ,
and i threw us into the flames ,
well , i felt something die ,
'cause i knew that that was the last time , the last time ,
sometimes i wake up by the door ,
and heard you calling , must be waiting for you ,
even now when we 're already over ,
i ca n't help myself from looking for you ,
but i set fire to the rain ,
watched it pour as i touched your face ,
well , it burned while i cried ,
'cause i heard it screaming out your name , your name ,
i set fire to the rain ,
and i threw us into the flames ,
well , i felt something die ,
'cause i knew that that was the last time , the last time ,

when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all to-gether
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all to-gether
at sky-fall
yes at sky-fall
skyfall is where we start
a thousand miles and poles apart
where worlds collide and days are dark
you may have my number you can take my name
but you ’ ll never have my heart
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all to-gether
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all to-gether
at sky-fall
where you go i go
what you see i see
i know i 'd never be me
wthout the se-curity
of your loving arms
keeping me from harm
put your hand in my hand
and we 'll stand
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all to-gether
let the sky fall
when it crumbles
we will stand tall
and face it all to-gether
at sky-fall let the sky fall
we will stand tall

song over
i heard that you 're settled down
that you found a girl
and you 're married now
i heard that your dreams came true
guess she gave you things
i did n't give to you
old friend why are you so shy
it ai n't like you to hold back
or hide from life
i hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but
i 'd hoped you 'd see my face
and that you 'd be reminded that for me it is n't over
never mind , i 'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
do n't forget me i beg i re-member you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead , yeah
you 'd know how time flies
only yesterday
was the time of our lives
we were born and raised
in a summer haze
bound by the surprise of our glory days
i hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but
i could n't stay away i could n't fight it
i 'd hoped you 'd see my face
and that you 'd be reminded that for me it is n't over
never mind , i 'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
do n't forget me i beg i re-member you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead , yeah
nothing compares no worries or cares
regrets and mistakes their memories make
who would have known how
bitter-sweet this would taste
never mind i ’ ll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
do n't forget me i beg i re-member you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
never mind i ’ ll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
do n't forget me i beg i re-member you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

everybody loves the things you do
from the way you talk to the way you move
everybody here is watching you
cause you feel like home , you 're like a dream come true
but if by chance you 're here alone
can i have a moment before i go
cause i 've been by myself all night long
hoping you 're someone i used to know
you look like a movie
you sound like a song
my god this reminds me
of when we were young
let me photograph you in this light , in case it is the last time
that we might be exactly like we were before we realized
we were sad of getting old , it made us restless
it was just like a movie , it was just like a song
i was so scared to face my fears
cause nobody told me that you 'd be here
that 's what you said when you left me
you still look like a movie
you still sound like a song
my god this reminds me
of when we were young
let me photograph you in this light , in case it is the last time
that we might be exactly like we were before we realized
we were sad of getting old , it made us restless
it was just like a movie , it was just like a song
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
it 's hard to win me back , everything just takes me back
to when you were there
to when you were there
and a part of me keeps holding on just in case it has n't gone
i guess i still care
do you still care ?
it was just like a movie
it was just like a song
my god this reminds me
of when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
when we were young
let me photograph you in this light , in case it is the last time
that we might be exactly like we were before we realized
we were sad of getting old , it made us restless
oh , i 'm so mad i 'm getting old , it makes me reckless
it was just like a movie , it was just like a song
when we were young

i 'm sorry if i seem uninterested
or i 'm not listenin ' , or i 'm indifferent
truly i ai n't got no business here
but since my friends are here , i just came to kick it
but really i would rather be at home all by myself
not in this room with people who do n't even care about my well-being
i do n't dance , do n't ask , i do n't need a boyfriend
so you can , go back , please enjoy your party
i 'll be here , somewhere in the corner
under clouds of marijuana , with this boy who 's hollering
i can hardly hear , over this music i do n't listen to and i do n't wan na get with you , so tell my friends that i 'll be over here
oh-oh-oh here , oh-oh-oh here
oh i asked myself , what am i doin ' here ?
oh-oh-oh here , oh-oh-oh here
and i ca n't wait 'til we can break up out
excuse me if i seem a little unimpressed with this
an anti-social pessimist , but usually i do n't mess with this
and i know you mean only the best and your
intentions are n't to bother me , but honestly i 'd rather be
somewhere with my people , we can kick it and just listen to
some music with a message , like we usually do
and we 'll discuss our big dreams , how we plan to take over the planet
so pardon my manners , i hope you 'll understand that i 'll be here
not there in the kitchen , with the girl who 's always gossiping about her friends
so tell them i 'll be here , right next to the boy who 's throwin ' up
cause he ca n't take what 's in his cup no more oh god why am i here ?
oh-oh-oh here , oh-oh-oh here
oh i asked myself , what am i doin ' here ?
oh-oh-oh here , oh-oh-oh here
and i ca n't wait 'til we can break up out of here
hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
some girl talkin ' 'bout her haters , she ai n't got none
how did it ever come to this ? i should 've never come to this
so holla at me , i 'll be in the car when you 're done
i 'm stand-offish , do n't want what you 're offerin '
and i 'm done talkin ' , awfully sad it had to be that way
so tell my people when they 're ready that i 'm ready
and i 'm standin ' by the tv with my beanie low yo i 'll be over here
oh-oh-oh here , oh-oh-oh here
oh i asked myself , what am i doin ' here ?

she just wants to be
beautiful she goes
unnoticed , she knows
no limits she craves
attention , she praises
she prays to be
sculpted by the sculptor
oh , she do n't see
the light that 's shining
deeper than the eyes can find it
maybe we have made her blind
so she tries to cover up her pain
and cut her woes away
'cause covergirls do n't cry
but there 's a hope
that 's waiting for you in the dark
you should know you 're beautiful
just the way you are
and you do n't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful ,
we 're stars and we 're beautiful
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
and you do n't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful ,
we 're stars and we 're beautiful
she has dreams to be
an envy , so she 's
covergirls eat nothing she says
`` beauty is pain and there 's beauty in everything ''
`` what 's a little bit of hunger ? ''
she fades away
she do n't see her perfect ,
she do n't understand she 's worth it
or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
oh oh
oh oh
so to all the girls that 's hurting
let me be your mirror ,
help you see a little bit clearer
there 's a hope
that 's waiting for you in the dark
you should know you 're beautiful
just the way you are
and you do n't have to change a thing
the world could change its heart
no scars to your beautiful ,

it 's not like we 're dead
was it something i did ?
was it something you said ?
do n't leave me hanging
in a city so dead
held up so high
on such a breakable thread
you were all the things i thought i knew
and i thought we could be
you were everything , everything
that i wanted
we were meant to be , supposed to be
but we lost it
all of our memories so close to me
just fade away
all this time you were pretending
so much for my happy ending
-oh , oh , oh , oh- so much for my happy ending

you 've got your dumb friends
i know what they say
they tell you i 'm difficult
but so are they
but they do n't know me
do they even know you ?
all the things you hide from me
all the xxxx that you do ?
you were all the things i thought i knew
and i thought we could be
you were everything , everything
that i wanted
we were meant to be , supposed to be
but we lost it
all of our memories so close to me
just fade away
all this time you were pretending
so much for my happy ending
it 's nice to know that you were there
thanks for acting like you cared
and making me feel like i was the only one
it 's nice to know we had it all
thanks for watching as i fall
and letting me know we were done
he was everything , everything
that i wanted ...
we were meant to be , supposed to be

all of the memories so close to me
just fade away
all this time you were pretending

well i could n't tell you ,
why she felt that way she felt it everday
and i could n't help her
i just watched her make the same mistakes again
what 's wrong what 's wrong now
too many too many problems
do n't know where she belongs
she wants to go home but nobody 's home
its where she lies , broken inside
with no place to go , no place to go
well open your eyes
and look outside , find the reasons why
you 've been rejected , and now you ca n't find
be strong be strong now
too many too many problems
do n't know where she belongs
she wants to go home but nobody 's home
its where she lies , broken inside
with no place to go , no place to go
her feelings she hides
her dreams she ca n't find
she 's losing her mind
and she ca n't find her place
she 's losing her faith
and she 's falling from grace
she wants to go home , but nobody 's home
its where she lies , broken inside
with no place to go , no place to go
to dry her eyes , broken inside
she 's lost inside
lost inside oh-oh
she 's lost inside
lost inside oh-oh yeah ...
song over
he was a boy , she was a girl
can i make it anymore obvious ?
he was a punk , and she did ballet
what more can i say ?
he wanted her , she 'd never tell ,
secretly she wanted him as well .
but all of the friends , stuck up their nose ,
they had a problem with his baggy clothes .
he was a skater boy , she said see ya later boy ,
he was n't good enough for her
she had a pretty face , but her head was up in spaces ,
she needed to come back down to earth
five years from now , she sits at home ,
feeding the baby she 's all alone .
she turns on tv , guess who she sees ,
skater boy rockin ' up mtv .
she calls up her friends , they already know ,
they 've all got tickets to see his show .
she tags along , and stands in the crowd ,
looks up at the man that she turn dooowwnnnn .
he was a skater boy , she said see ya later boy ,
he was n't good enough for her .
now he 's a superstar , slammin ' on his guitar
does your pretty face see what he 's worth ?
he was a skater boy , she said see ya later boy ,
he was n't good enough for her .
now he 's a superstar , slammin ' on his guitar
does your pretty face see what he 's worth ?
sorry girl but you missed out ,
well tough luck that boy 's mine now .
we are more than just good friends ,
this is how the story ends .
too bad that you could n't see ,
see the man that boy could be .
there is more than meets the eye ,
i see the soul that is inside .
he 's just a boy , and i 'm just a girl ,
can i make it anymore obvious ?
he was a punk , and she did ballet
we are in love , have n't you heard ?
how we rock each other 's world ?
i 'm with the skater boy , i said see ya later boy ,
i 'll be back stage after the show .
i 'll be at out studio , singing the song he wrote ,
about the girl you used to know .
i 'm with the skater boy , i said see ya later boy ,

i always needed time on my own
i never thought i 'd need you there when i cried
and the days feel like years
when i 'm alone
and the bed where you lie
is made up on your side
when you walk away
i count the steps that you take
do you see how much i need you right now ?
when you 're gone
the pieces of my heart are missing you
when you 're gone
the face i came to know is missing too
when you 're gone
the words i need to hear to always get me through the day
and make it ok
i 've never felt this way before
everything that i do reminds me of you
and the clothes you left , they lie on the floor
and they smell just like you
i love the things that you do
when you walk away
i count the steps that you take
do you see how much i need you right now ?
when you 're gone
the pieces of my heart are missing you
when you 're gone
the face i came to know is missing too
when you 're gone
the words i need to hear to always get me through the day
and make it ok
i miss you
we were made for each other
out there forever , i know we were
yeah yea
all i ever wanted was for you to know
everything i do i give my heart and soul
i can hardly breath , i need to feel you here
with me , yeah
when you 're gone
the pieces of my heart are missing you
when you 're gone
the face i came to know is missing too
when you 're gone
the words i need to hear to always get me through the day

to make me weak inside
girl you leave me breathless
but it 's okay
cause you are my survival
now hear me say
i ca n't imagine
life without your love
and even forever
do n't seem like long enough
cause everytime i breathe i take you in
and my heart beats again
baby i ca n't help it
you keep me drowning in your love
everytime i try to rise above
i 'm swept away by love
baby i ca n't help it
you keep me drowning in your love
maybe i 'm a drifter
late at night
cause i long for the safety
of flowing freely in your arms
i do n't need another lover
it 's not for me
cause only you can save me
oh ca n't you see

life without your love
and even forever

it 's the perfect time of year
somewhere far away from here
i feel fine enough , i guess
considering everything 's a mess
there 's a restaurant down the street
where hungry people like to eat
i could walk but i 'll just drive
it 's colder than it looks out side .
it 's like a dream you try to remember but it 's gone
then ya ' try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
when you try to see the world beyond your front door
take your time , is the way i rhyme 's gon na make you smile
when you realize that a guy my size might take a while
just try to figure out what all this is for ?
it 's the perfect time of day
to throw all your cares away
put the sprinkler on the lawn
and run through with my gym shorts on .
take a drink right from the hose
and change into some drier clothes
climb the stairs up to my room
sleep away the afternoon .
it 's like a dream you try to remember but it 's gone
then ya ' try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
when you try to see the world beyond your front door
take your time , is the way i rhyme 's gon na make you smile
when you realize that a guy my size might take a while
just try to figure out what all this is for ?
pinch me , pinch me , cause i 'm still asleep
please god tell me that i 'm still asleep
on an evening such as this
it 's hard to tell if i exist
packed a car and leave this town
who 'll notice that i 'm not around ?
i could hide out under there
i just made you say 'underwear '
i could leave but i 'll just stay
all my stuff 's here anyway .
it 's like a dream you try to remember but it 's gone
then ya ' try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
when you try to see the world beyond your front door
take your time , is the way i rhyme 's gon na make you smile
when you realize that a guy my size might take a while
just try to figure out what all this is for ?
try to figure out what all this is for
try to see the world beyond your front door
try to figure out what all this is for

shuts my eyes and count to ten

burning bright right till the end
now you ’ ll be missing from the photographs , missing from the photographs
watching through my fingers

in my thoughts you ’ re far away
and you are whistling a melody , whistling a melody
crystallizing clear as day
oh i can picture you so easily , picture you so easily
what ’ s gon na be left of the world , if you ’ re not in it ?

caught off guard by your favorite song
oh i ’ ll be dancing at a funeral , dancing at a funeral
sleeping in the clothes you love
it ’ s such a shame we have to see them burn , shame we have to see them burn

song over
i was left to my own devices
many days fell away with nothing to show
and the walls kept tumbling down
in the city that we loved
great clouds roll over the hills
bringing darkness from above
but if you close your eyes ,
does it almost feel like
nothing changed at all ?
and if you close your eyes ,
does it almost feel like
you 've been here before ?
how am i gon na be an optimist about this ?
how am i gon na be an optimist about this ?
we were caught up and lost in all of our vices
in your pose as the dust settles around us
and the walls kept tumbling down
in the city that we loved
great clouds roll over the hills
bringing darkness from above
but if you close your eyes ,
does it almost feel like
nothing changed at all ?
and if you close your eyes ,
does it almost feel like
you 've been here before ?
how am i gon na be an optimist about this ?
how am i gon na be an optimist about this ?
oh where do we begin ?
the rubble or our sins ?
oh where do we begin ?
the rubble or our sins ?
and the walls kept tumbling down
in the city that we loved
great clouds roll over the hills
bringing darkness from above
but if you close your eyes ,

nothing changed at all ?
and if you close your eyes ,

song over
we were making history
breaking rules and breaking free
questioning the writing on the wall
got wind from the underground
laughing as were falling down
soaking in the glory of it all
but in dark times when we close our eyes
it ’ s a nightmare , it ’ s a nightmare
when the sun don ’ t shine we lose our mind
but i swear , we can get there
we ’ ve got young blood
can ’ t destroy us
we make our own luck in this world
we ’ ve got young blood
no one chose us
we make our own love in this world
someday we could run away
see it all before the pictures fade
bottle up the feeling in a jar
pass around to all our friends
we could breathe it in all again
huddled in the backseat of the car
but in dark times when we close our eyes
it ’ s a nightmare , it ’ s a nightmare
when the sun don ’ t shine we lose our mind
but i swear , we can get there
we ’ ve got young blood
can ’ t destroy us
we make our own luck in this world
we ’ ve got young blood
no one chose us
we make our own love in this world
and our voices will get loud
if they never loved you shut them out
if you ’ re lost you could be found
if you follow me till you hear the sound
put ‘ em up put ‘ em up now
if you know we ’ re never backing down
we ’ re never backing down
we ’ ve got young blood
can ’ t destroy us
we make our own luck in this world
we ’ ve got young blood
no one chose us
we make our own love in this world

if i were a boy
even just for a day
i ’ d roll out of bed in the morning
and throw on what i wanted and go
drink beer with the guys
and chase after girls
i ’ d kick it with who i wanted
and i ’ d never get confronted for it
because they ’ d stick up for me
if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i ’ d be a better man
i ’ d listen to her
cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted
cause he ’ s taken you for granted
and everything you had got destroyed
if i were a boy
i think i could understand
how it feels to love a girl
i swear i ’ d be a better man
i ’ d listen to her
cause i know how it hurts
when you lose the one you wanted
cause he ’ s taken you for granted
and everything you had got destroyed
it ’ s a little too late for you to come back
say its just a mistake
think i forgive you like that
if you thought i would wait for you
you thought wrong
and everything you had got destroyed
but you 're just a boy

do n't ya know i 'm no good for you .
i 've learned to lose , you ca n't afford too
tore my shirt to stop you bleeding
but nothing ever stops you leaving
quiet when i 'm coming home , i 'm on my own
i could lie and say i like it like that , like it like that
i could lie and say i like it like that , like it like that
do n't ya know too much already
i 'll only hurt you if you let me
call me friend , but keep me closer
-call me back-
and i 'll call you when the party 's over
quiet when i 'm coming home , i 'm on my own
i could lie and say i like it like that , like it like that
i could lie and say i like it like that , like it like that
but nothing is better , sometimes
once we 've both said our goodbyes
let 's just let it go
let me let you go
quiet when i 'm coming home , i 'm on my own
i could lie and say i like it like that , like it like that
i could lie and say i like it like that , like it like that
song over
candy , she 's sweet like candy in my veins
baby , i 'm dying for another taste
and every night my mind is running around her
thunder 's getting louder and louder
baby you 're like lightning in a bottle
i ca n't let you go now that i got it
and all i need is to be struck by your electric love
baby your electric love
electric love
drown me
you make my heart beat like the rain
surround me
hold me deep beneath your waves
and every night my mind is running around her
thunder 's getting louder and louder
baby you 're like lightning in a bottle
i ca n't let you go now that i got it
and all i need is to be struck by your electric love
baby your electric love
electric love
rushing through me
feel your energy rushing through me
feel your energy rushing through me
baby you 're like lightning in a bottle
i ca n't let you go now that i got it
and all i need is to be struck by your electric love
baby your electric love
electric love
song over
i almost got drunk at school at 14
where i almost made out with the homecoming queen
who almost went on to be miss texas
but lost to a slut with much bigger breastes
where i was almost famous for almost a day
and i almost had you
but i guess that does n't cut it
almost loved you
i almost wished u would 've loved me too
i almost held up a grocery store
where i almost did 5 years and then 7 more
cuz i almost got popped for a fight with a thug
cuz he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs
that i almost got hooked on cuz you ran away
and i wish i woulda had the nerve to ask you to stay
and i almost had you
but i guess that does n't cut it
almost loved you
i almost wished u would 've loved me too
you kept me guessing and now i guess that
i spent my time missing you
i almost wish you would 've loved me too
here i go thinking about all the things i could 've done
i 'm gon na need a forklift cuz all the baggage weighs a ton
i know we 've had our problems i ca n't remember one
i almost forgot to say something else
and if i cant fit it in i 'll keep it all to myself
i almost wrote a song about you today
but i tore it all open and i threw it away
and i almost had you
but i guess that does n't cut it
almost had you
and i did n't even know it
you kept me guessing and now i guess that
i spent my time missing you
and i almost had you
i almost wish you would 've loved me too
song over
8 o'clock , monday night and i 'm waitin '
to finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me .
her name is nona , she 's a rocker with a nose ring ,
she wears a two way , but i 'm not quite sure what that means .
and when she walks ,
all the wind blows and the angels sing .
but she does n't notice me !
cause she is watchin ' wrestling
creamin ' over tough guys
listenin ' to rap metal
turntables in her eyes
it 's like a bad movie
she is lookin ' through me
if you were me , then you 'd be
screamin ' `` someone shoot me ! ''
as i fail miserably ,
tryin ' to get the girl all the bad guys want .
she likes the godsmack and i like agent orange
her cd changer 's full of singers that are mad at their dad
she says she 'd like to score some reefer and a forty
she 'll never know that i 'm the best that she 'll never have
and when she walks ,
all the wind blows and the angels sing .
but she does n't notice me !
cause she is watchin ' wrestling
creamin ' over tough guys
listenin ' to rap metal
turntables in her eyes
she likes 'em with a moustache
racetrack season pass
does a mullet make a man ?
it 's like a bad movie
she is lookin ' through me
if you were me , then you 'd be
screamin ' `` someone shoot me ! ''
as i fail miserably ,
tryin ' to get the girl all the bad guys want .
there she goes again
with fishnets on , and dreadlocks in her hair
she broke my heart , i wan na be sedated
all i wanted was to see her naked !
it 's like a bad movie
she is lookin ' through me
if you were me , then you 'd be
screamin ' `` someone shoot me ! ''
as i fail miserably ,
tryin ' to get the girl all the bad guys want .
song over
it 's too late baby , there 's no turning around
i got my hands in my pocket and my head in a cloud
this is how i do
when i think about you
i never thought that you could break me apart
i keep a sinister smile and a hole in my heart
you want to get inside
then you can get in line
cause you caught me off guard
now i 'm running and screaming
i feel like a hero and you are my heroine
i wo n't try to philosophize
i 'll just take a deep breath then i 'll look in your eyes
this is how i feel
and it 's so so real
i 've got ta closet filled up to the brim
with the ghosts of my past and the skeletons
and i do n't know why you 'd even try
cause you caught me off guard
now i 'm running and screaming
i feel like a hero and you are my her-oine
do you know that your love is the sweetest sin
and i feel a weakness coming on
it never felt so good to be so wrong
had my heart on lock down
and then you turned me around
and i 'm feeling like a newborn child
every time i get a chance to see you smile
it 's not complicated
i was so jaded
cause you caught me off guard
now i 'm running and screaming
i feel like a hero and you are my her-oine
do you know that your love is the sweetest sin
i feel like a hero and you are my her-oine
do you know that your love is the sweetest sin
song over
top down in the summer sun
the day we met was like a hit and run
and i still taste it on my tongue -taste it on my tongue-
the sky was burning up like fireworks
you made me want you oh so bad it hurts
but girl , in case you have n't heard
i used to be love drunk
but now i 'm hungover
i 'll love you forever
forever is over
we used to kiss all night
now it 's just a barfight
so do n't call me crying
say hello to goodbye
cause just one sip
would make me say
i used to be love drunk
but now i 'm hungover
i 'll love you forever
but now it 's over
-hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! -
hot sweat and blurry eyes
we 're spinning on a roller coaster ride
the world stuck in black and white
you drove me crazy every time we touched
now im so broken that i ca n't get up
oh girl , you make me such a lush
i used to be love drunk
but now i 'm hungover
i 'll love you forever
forever is over
we used to kiss all night
now it 's just a barfight
so do n't call me crying
say hello to goodbye
cause just one sip
would make me say
i used to be love drunk
but now i 'm hungover
i 'll love you forever
but now it 's over
all the time i wasted on you
all the bullxxxx you put me through
i 'm checking into rehab
cause everything that we had
did n't mean a thing to youuuuuuuuu
i used to be love drunk
but now i 'm hungover
i 'll love you forever
but now it 's over ...
i used to be love drunk
but now i 'm hungover
i 'll love you forever
forever is over
we used to kiss all night
now it 's just a barfight
so do n't call me crying
say hello to goodbye
cause just one sip

i used to be love drunk
but now i 'm hungover
i 'll love you forever
but now it 's over
nananana na na na na na
nananana na na na na na
but now it 's over
song over
paper bags and plastic hearts
all are belongings in shopping carts
it 's goodbye
but we got one more night
let 's get drunk and ride around
and make peace with an empty town
we can make it right
throw it away
forget yesterday
we 'll make the great escape
we wo n't hear a word they say
they do n't know us anyway
watch it burn
let it die
cause we are finally free tonight
tonight will change our lives
it 's so good to be by your side
but we 'll cry
we wo n't give up the fight
we 'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
and they 'll think it 's just cause we 're young
and we 'll feel so alive
throw it away
forget yesterday
we 'll make the great escape
we wo n't hear a word they say
they do n't know us anyway
watch it burn
let it die
cause we are finally free tonight
all of the wasted time
the hours that were left behind
the answers that we 'll never find
they do n't mean a thing tonight
throw it away
forget yesterday
we 'll make the great escape
we wo n't hear a word they say
they do n't know us anyway
throw it away
forget yesterday
we 'll make the great escape
we wo n't hear a word they say
they do n't know us anyway
throw it away
forget yesterday
we 'll make the great escape
we wo n't hear a word they say
they do n't know us anyway
watch it burn
let it die
cause we are finally free tonight

come notice me
and take my hand
so why are we
strangers when
our love is strong
why carry on without me ?
and everytime i try to fly i fall without my wings
i feel so small . i guess i need you baby
and everytime i see you in my dreams i see your face ,
it 's haunting me . i guess i need you baby
i make be-lieve
that you are here
it 's the only way
i see clear
what have i done
you seem to move on easy
and everytime i try to fly i fall without my wings
i feel so small . i guess i need you baby
and everytime i see you in my dreams i see your face ,
it 's haunting me . i guess i need you baby
i may have made it rain
please forgive me
my weakness caused you pain
and this song is my sorry
ohhhh
at night i pray
that soon your face will fade away
and everytime i try to fly i fall without my wings
i feel so small . i guess i need you baby
and everytime i see you in my dreams i see your face ,
it 's haunting me . i guess i need you baby

song over
same bed , but it feels just a little bit bigger now
our song on the radio , but it do n't sound the same
when our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
cause my heart breaks a little when i hear your name
it all just sounds like ooh , ooh , oooh , oooh
mmm too young , too dumb to realize
that i should 've bought you flowers and held your hand
shoulda gave you all my hours when i had the chance
take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
now my baby 's dancing , but she 's dancing with another man
my pride , my ego , my needs and my selfish ways
caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
now i 'll never , never get to clean up the mess i made ooh
and that haunts me every time i close my eyes
it all just sounds like ooh , ooh , oooh , oooh
mmm too young , too dumb to realize
that i should 've bought you flowers and held your hand
shoulda gave you all my hours when i had the chance
take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
now my baby 's dancing , but she 's dancing with another man
although it hurts i 'll be the first to say that i was wrong
oh , i know i 'm probably much too late
to try and apologize for my mistakes
but i just want you to know
i hope he buys you flowers , i hope he holds your hand
give you all his hours when he has the chance
take you to every party cause i remember how much you love to dance
do all the things i should 've done when i was your man
do all the things i should 've done when i was your man
song over
i spend all my money on a big ol ' fancy car
for these bright eyed honeys
oh yeah you know who you are
keep me up 'til the sun is high
'til the birds start calling my name
i 'm addicted and i do n't know why
guess i 've always been this way
all these roads steer me wrong
but i still drive them all night long , all night long
all you young wild girls
you make a mess of me
yeah you young wild girls
you 'll be the death of me , the death of me
all you young wild girls
no matter what you do
yeah you young wild girls
i 'll always come back to you , come back to you
i get lost under these lights
i get lost in the words i say
start believing my own lies
like everything will be okay
oh i still dream of simple life
boy meets girl makes her his wife
but love do n't exist when you live like this that much i know , yes i know
all these roads steer me wrong
but i still drive them all night long , all night long
all you young wild girls
you make a mess of me
yeah you young wild girls
you 'll be the death of me , the death of me
all you young wild girls
no matter what you do
yeah you young wild girls
i 'll always come back to you , come back to you
you , you , you , you
you , you , you , you
yeah , you , you , you
you , you , you , you
all you young wild girls
you make a mess of me
yeah you young wild girls
you 'll be the death of me , the death of me
all you young wild girls
no matter what you do
yeah you young wild girls
i 'll always come back to you , come back to you

big black sky over my town
i know where you at , i bet she 's around
yeah , i know it 's stupid
i just got ta see it for myself
i 'm in the corner , watching you kiss her , oh..
i 'm right over here , why ca n't you see me , oh..
i 'm giving it my all , but i 'm not the guy your taking home , ooohh..
i keep dancing on my own
i 'm just gon na dance all night
i 'm all messed up , i 'm so outta line
stilettos and broken bottles ,
i 'm spinnin ' around in circles
i 'm in the corner , watching you kiss her , oh..
i 'm right over here , why ca n't you see me , oh..
i 'm giving it my all , but i 'm not the guy your taking home , ooohh..
i keep dancing on my own
so far away but still so near -the lights go on , the music dies-
but you do n't see me standing here -i just came to say goodbye-
i 'm in the corner , watching you kiss her , oh..
i 'm giving it my all , but i 'm not the guy your taking home , ooohh..

i feel so close to you right now it 's a force field

your love pours down on me ,
surround me like a waterfall
and there 's no stopping us right now

i feel so close to you right now it 's a force field
i wear my heart upon my sleeve , like a big deal

song over
when i met you in the summer
to my heartbeat sound
we fell in love
as the leaves turned brown
we could be together baby
as long as skies are blue
you act so innocent now
but you lied so soon
song over
dirty tissues , trust issues
glasses on the sink , they did n't fix you
lonely pillows in a stranger 's bed
little voices in my head
secret keeping , stop the bleeding
lost a little weight because i was n't eating
all the souls that i ca n't listen to ,
to tell the truth
loving you was young , and wild , and free
loving you was cool , and hot , and sweet
loving you was sunshine , safe and sound
but loving you had consequences
hesitation , awkward conversation
running on low expectation
every siren that i was ignoring
i 'm paying for it
loving you was young , and wild , and free
loving you was cool , and hot , and sweet
loving you was sunshine , safe and sound
but loving you had consequences
loving you was dumb , dark and cheap
loving you still takes shots at me
loving you was sunshine , but then it poured
and i lost so much more than my senses
'cause loving you had consequences
song over
i threw a wish in the well ,
do n't ask me , i 'll never tell
i looked to you as it fell ,
i trade my soul for a wish ,
pennies and dimes for a kiss
i was n't looking for this ,
your stare was holdin ' ,
ripped jeans , skin was showin '
hot night , wind was blowin '
where you think you 're going , baby ?
hey , i just met you ,
and this is crazy ,
but here 's my number ,
it 's hard to look right ,
at you baby ,
but here 's my number ,
hey , i just met you ,
and this is crazy ,
but here 's my number ,
and all the other boys ,
try to chase me ,
but here 's my number ,
you took your time with the call ,
i took no time with the fall
you gave me nothing at all ,
i beg , and borrow and steal
have foresight and it 's real
i did n't know i would feel it , but it 's in my way
your stare was holdin ' ,
ripped jeans , skin was showin '
hot night , wind was blowin '
where you think you 're going , baby ?
hey , i just met you ,
and this is crazy ,
but here 's my number ,
it 's hard to look right ,
at you baby ,
but here 's my number ,
hey , i just met you ,
and this is crazy ,
but here 's my number ,
and all the other boys ,
try to chase me ,
but here 's my number ,
before you came into my life
i missed you so bad
i missed you so , so bad
before you came into my life
i missed you so bad
i missed you so , so bad
it 's hard to look right ,
at you baby ,
but here 's my number ,
hey , i just met you ,
and this is crazy ,
but here 's my number ,
and all the other boys ,
try to chase me ,
but here 's my number ,
before you came into my life
i missed you so bad
i missed you so so bad
before you came into my life
and you should know that
song over
i wan na smash your fears
and get drunken off your tears
do n't you share your smile with anyone else but me
i wan na touch your heart
i wan na crush it in my hands
make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies
we 're not lovers , but more than friends
put a flame to every single word you ever said
no more crying , to get me through
i 'll keep dancing till the morning with somebody new
tonight i 'm getting over you
tonight i 'm getting over you
tonight i 'm getting over you
tonight i 'm getting over you
stuck in a real bad dream , and man it feels so new to me
should be in your arms but i 'm begging at your feet
it 's been a real hard night
and i just hold my pillow tight
it wo n't love me back , no ,
it 's not you and i
we 're not lovers
but more than friends
put a flame to every single word you ever said
no more crying , to get me through
i 'll keep dancing till the morning with somebody new
tonight i 'm getting over you , tonight i 'm getting over you
tonight i 'm getting over you , tonight i 'm getting over you
tonight i 'm getting over you , tonight i 'm getting over you

song over
right now he 's probably slow dancing with a bleached-blond tramp ,
and she 's probably getting frisky
right now , he 's probably buying her some fruity little drink cause she
ca n't shoot whiskey
right now , he 's probably up behind her with a pool-stick , showing her how
to shoot a combo and he do n't know
that i dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up four wheel drive ,
carved my name into his leather seat
i took a louisville slugger to both head lights , slashed a hole in all 4 tires
and maybe next time he 'll think before he cheats .
right now , she 's probably up singing some white-trash version of shania karoke
right now , she 's probably saying `` i 'm drunk '' and he 's a thinking that he 's gon na lucky ,
right now , he 's probably dabbing 3 dollars worth of that bathroom polo
and he do n't know
that i dug my key into the side of his pretty little suped up four wheel drive ,
carved my name into his leather seat
i took a louisville slugger to both head lights , slashed a hole in all 4 tires
and maybe next time he 'll think before he cheats .
i might save a little trouble for the next girl ,
cause the next time that he cheats
oh , you know it wo n't be on me !
ohh ... not on me
that i dug my key into the side of his pretty little supped up four wheel drive ,
carved my name into his leather seat
i took a louisville slugger to both head lights , slashed a hole in all 4 tires
and maybe next time he 'll think before he cheats .
maybe next time he 'll think before he cheats .
ohh.. maybe next time he 'll think before he cheats
ohh ... before he cheats
song over
i still hear your voice , when you sleep next to me .
i still feel your touch in my dreams .
forgive me my weakness , but i do n't know why
without you it 's hard to survive .
'cause everytime we touch , i get this feeling .
and everytime we kiss i swear i could fly .
ca n't you feel my heart beat fast , i want this to last .
need you by my side .
'cause everytime we touch , i feel the static .
and everytime we kiss , i reach for the sky .
ca n't you hear my heart beat so ...
i ca n't let you go .
want you in my life .
your arms are my castle , your heart is my sky .
they wipe away tears that i cry .
the good and the bad times , we 've been through them all .
you make me rise when i fall .
'cause everytime we touch , i get this feeling .
and everytime we kiss i swear i could fly .
ca n't you feel my heart beat fast , i want this to last .
need you by my side .
'cause everytime we touch , i feel the static .
and everytime we kiss , i reach for the sky .
ca n't you hear my heart beat so ...
i ca n't let you go .
want you in my life .

tarzan and jane were swingin ' on a vine
sippin ' from a bottle of vodka double wine
hey yeah uh
i met him out for dinner on a friday night
he really had me working up an appetite
he had tattoos up and down his arm
there 's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm
he 's a one stop shop , makes the panties drop
he 's a sweet-talkin ' , sugar coated candy man
a sweet-talkin ' , sugar coated candyman
he took me to the spider club at hollywood and vine
we drank champagne and we danced all night
we shook the paparazzi for a big surprise
the gossip tonight will be tomorrow 's headline
he 's a one stop shop , make my cherry pop
he 's a sweet-talkin ' , sugar coated candy man
ye ... a ... h !
he 's a one stop shop , make my cherry pop
he 's a sweet-talkin ' , sugar coated candy man
a sweet-talkin ' , sugar coated candyman
well by now i 'm getting all bothered and hot
when he kissed my mouth he really hit the spot
he had lips like sugar cane
good things come to boys who wait
tarzan and jane were swingin ' on a vine
candy man candy man
sipping from a bottle of vodka double wine
candy man , candy man
he got those lips like sugar cane
good things come for boys who wait
he 's a one stop shop with a real big egh
he 's a sweet-talkin ' , sugar coated candyman
he 's a sweet-talkin ' , sugar coated candyman

jane lost her grip and a-down she fell
jane lost her grip and a-down she fell
squared herself away as she let out a yell

song over
heart beats fast colors and promises
how to be brave how can i love
when i 'm afraid to fall but watching you stand alone
all of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
one step closer
i have died every day waiting for you
darling do n't be afraid i have loved you
for a thousand years i 'll love you for a thousand more
time stands still beauty in all she is
i will be brave i will not let anything
take away what 's standing in front of me
every breath every hour
has come to this
one step closer
i have died every day waiting for you
darling do n't be afraid i have loved you
for a thousand years i 'll love you for a thousand more
all along i believed i would find you
time has brought your heart to me i have loved you
for a thousand years i 'll love you for a thousand moooore
one step closer , one step closer
i have died every day waiting for you
darling do n't be afraid i have loved you
for a thousand years i 'll love you for a thousand more
all along i believed i would find you
time has brought your heart to me i have loved you
for a thousand years i 'll love you for a thousand moooore
song over
i know i ca n't take one more step towards you
'cause all thats waiting is regret
and do n't you know i 'm not your ghost anymore
you lost the love i loved the most
i learned to live half a life
and now you want me one more time
who do you think you are ?
running 'round leaving scars
collecting a jar of hearts
tearing love apart
you 're gon na catch a cold
from the ice inside your soul
do n't come back for me
who do you think you are ?
i hear you 're asking all around
if i am anywhere to be found
but i have grown too strong
to ever fall back in your arms
i 've learned to live half a life
and now you want me one more time
who do you think you are ?
running 'round leaving scars
collecting a jar of hearts
tearing love apart
you 're gon na catch a cold
from the ice inside your soul
do n't come back for me
who do you think you are ?
it took so long just to feel alright
remember how to put back the light in my eyes
i wish i had missed the first time that we kissed
'cause you broke all your promises
and now you 're back
you do n't get to get me back
who do you think you are ?
running 'round leaving scars
collecting a jar of hearts
and tearing love apart
you 're gon na catch a cold
from the ice inside your soul
so do n't come back for me
do n't come back at all
who do you think you are ?
running 'round leaving scars
collecting a jar of hearts
and tearing love apart
you 're gon na catch a cold
from the ice inside your soul
so do n't come back for me
do n't come back at all
who do you think you are ?
who do you think you are ?
who do you think you are ?
song over
this girl she came 'round
the corner , looking like a model
magazine figure , she was shaped like a bottle
long straight hair , she was fly as a bird
first time ever i was lost for words
felt so right , could n't be wrong
love at first sight , if that exists at all
i could n't move , felt like i was stuck
and then baby girl looked up
and i said hey there pretty brown eyes
watcha doin ' later tonight ?
mind if i spend time with you ?
and i said hey there pretty brown eyes
watcha doin ' later tonight ?
mind if i spend time with you ?
this girl she was a lil hottie ,
she know she got it
came from the city so she loves to party
the jt song make her move that body
she dancing all night long
cause i can tell that she was a wild one
that 's why i was shy at first ,
but i finally worked up the nerve
and i said hey there pretty brown eyes
watcha doin ' later tonight ?
mind if i spend time with you ?
and i said hey there pretty brown eyes
watcha doin ' later tonight ?
mind if i spend time with you ?
spend a little bit , a little bit of time with you
spend a little bit , a little bit of time with you
spend a little little , bit a bit a of time with you

hey hey little pretty brown eyes
do n't cha ever be looking at them other guys
cause ai n't never had a surfer like me
so start swimming over here and ride my wave
cause i see that you party like there 's no tomorrow
let 's leave the party , i 'll grab my guitar
i got the keys , so jump in my car
sit back relax , australia 's kinda far
and i said hey there pretty brown eyes
watcha doin ' later tonight ?
mind if i spend time with you ?

stopped me on the corner , i swear you hit me like a vision
i-i-i was n't expecting
but who am i to tell fate where it ’ s supposed to go with it ?
do n't you blink you might miss it
see we got a right to just love it or leave it , you find it and keep it
'cause it ai n't every day you get the chance to say
oh , this is how it starts , lighting strikes the heart
it goes off like a gun , brighter than the sun
oh , it could be the stars , falling from the sky
shining how we want , brighter than the sun
i 've never seen it , but i found this love , i wan na feed it
you better believe , i 'm gon na treat it better than anything i 've ever had
read it , it 's signed and delivered , let 's seal it
boy , we go together like peanuts and paydays , marley and reggae
and everybody needs to get a chance to say
oh , this is how it starts , lighting strikes the heart
it goes off like a gun , brighter than the sun
oh , it could be the stars , falling from the sky
shining how we want , brighter than the sun
everything is like a whiteout , 'cause we shicka-shicka-shine down
even when-the-when-the light 's out , but i can see you glow
got my head up in the rafters , got me happy ever after
never felt this way before , ai n't felt this way before
i swear you hit me like a vision
i-i-i wasn ’ t expecting
but who am i to tell fate where it 's supposed to go ?
oh , this is how it starts , lighting strikes the heart
it goes off like a gun , brighter than the sun
oh , it could be the stars , falling from the sky
shining how we want , brighter than the sun
oh , this is how it starts , lighting strikes the heart
it goes off like a gun , brighter than the sun
oh , it could be the stars , falling from the sky
shining how we want , brighter than the sun
brighter than the sun , brighter than the sun , brighter than the sun
oh , this is how it starts , lighting strikes the heart
goes off like a gun , brighter than the sun

goes off like a gun , brighter than the sun
oh , this is how it starts , lighting strikes the heart
goes off like a gun , brighter than the sun

lights go out i ca n't be saved tides that i tried to swim against
brought me down upon my knees , oh i beg i beg and plead -singing
come out of the things unsaid , shoot an apple off my head - and a
trouble that ca n't be named , tigers waiting to be tamed - singing
ye hooooooooh aahh ye hooooooooh aahh
confusion never stops , closing walls and ticking clocks - gon na
come back take you home i could not stop the tune now known singing
come out upon my seas , curse missed opportunities - am i
a part of the cure , or am i a part of the disease ? - singing
ye hooooooooh aahh ye hooooooooh aahh
ye hooooooooh aahh ye hooooooooh aahh
and nothing else compares
oh nothing else compares

song over
i turn the music up , i got my records on
i shut the world outside until the lights come on
maybe the streets alight , maybe the trees are gone
i feel my heart start beating to my favourite song
and all the kids they dance , all the kids all night
until monday morning feels another life
i turn the music up
and heaven is in sight
i turn the music up , i got my records on
from underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
don ’ t want to see another generation drop
i ’ d rather be a comma than a full stop
maybe i ’ m in the black , maybe i ’ m on my knees
maybe i ’ m in the gap batween the two trapezes
but my heart is beating and my pulses start
cathedrals in my heart
and we saw oh this light i swear you , emerge blinking into
to tell me it ’ s alright
as we soar walls , every siren is a symphony
and every tear ’ s a waterfall
is a waterfall
oh
is a waterfall
oh oh oh
is a is a waterfall
so you can hurt , hurt me bad
but still i ’ ll raise the flag
it was a wa wa wa wa wa-a-terfall
every tear
every tear
every teardrop is a waterfall
every tear
every tear
every teardrop is a waterfall
song over
how long before i get in
before it starts , before i begin
how long before you decide
before i know what it feels like
where to , where do i go
if you never tried then you 'll never know
how long do i have to climb
up on this side of this mountain of mine
look up , i look up at night
planets are moving at the speed of light
come up , up in the trees
every chance that you get is a chance you seize
how long am i can stand
with my head stuck under the sand
i 'll start before i can stop
or before i see things the right way up
all that noise , all that sound
all those places that i got found
and birds go flying at the speed of sound
to show how it all began
birds come flying from the underground
if you could see it then you 'd understand
ideas that you 'll never find
all the inventors could never design
the buildings that you put up
japan and china all lit up
the sign that i could n't read
all the light that i could n't see
somethings you have to believe
but others are puzzles , puzzling me
all that noise , all that sound
all those places that i got found
and birds go flying at the speed of sound
to show how it all began
birds come flying from the underground
if you could see it then you 'd understand
all those signs i knew what they meant
something you ca n't invent
some get made , and some get sent
ooh
and birds go flying at the speed of sound
to show how it all began
birds come flying from the underground
if you could see it then you 'd understand
oh when you see it then you 'll understand
song over
i used to rule the world
seas would rise when i gave the word
now in the morning i sleep alone
sweep the streets i used to own
i used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemy 's eyes
listen as the crowd would sing :
`` now the old king is dead ! long live the king ! ''
one minute i held the key
next the walls were closed on me
and i discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror , my sword , and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i ca n't explain
once you go there was never , never an honest word
that was when i ruled the world
it was the wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in .
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people could n't believe what i 'd become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
oh who would ever want to be king ?
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror , my sword , and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i ca n't explain
i know saint peter will call my name ,
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
- ohhhhh ohhh ohhh -
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror , my sword , and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i ca n't explain
i know saint peter will call my name ,
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
oooooh oooooh oooooh
song over
so she said what 's the problem baby
whats the problem i do n't know ,
well maybe i 'm in love -love-
think about it every time i think about it
ca n't stop thinking 'bout it
how much longer will it take to cure this
just to cure it cause i ca n't ignore it if its love -love-
makes me wan na turn around and face me but i do n't know
nothing 'bout love
come on , come on
turn a little faster
come on , come on
the world will follow after
come on , come on
cause everybody 's after love
so i said i 'm a snowball running ,
running down into the spring that 's coming all this love
melting under blue skies belting out sunlight
shimmering love
well baby i surrender to the strawberry ice cream
never ever end of all this love
well i did n't mean to do it
but there 's no escaping your love
these line of lightning mean we 're
never alone , never alone ,
come on , come on
move a little closer
come on , come on
i want to hear you whisper
come on , come on
settle down inside my love
come on , come on
jump a little higher
come on , come on
if you feel a little lighter
come on , come on
we were once upon a time in love
we 're accidentally in love
we 're accidentally in love
we 're accidentally in love
we 're accidentally in love
we 're accidentally in love
we 're accidentally in love
we 're accidentally in love
we 're accidentally in love
i 'm in love , i 'm in love
i 'm in love , i 'm in love
i 'm in love , i 'm in love
i 'm in love , i 'm in love
i 'm in love , i 'm in love
i 'm in love , i 'm in love
come on , come on
spin a little tighter
come on , come on
and the world 's a little brighter
come on , come on
just get yourself inside her love
song over
please come now , i think i 'm falling
i 'm holding on to all i think is safe
i seem to 've found the road to nowhere
and i 'm trying to escape
i yelled back when i heard thunder
but i 'm down to one last breath
and with it let me say , let me say
hold me now
i 'm six feet from the edge and i 'm thinkin '
maybe six feet ai n't so far down
i 'm looking down , now that it 's over
reflecting on all of my mistakes
i thought i found the road to somewhere ,
somewhere in his grace
i cried out `` heaven save me ! ''
but i 'm down to one last breath
and with it let me say , let me say
hold me now
i 'm six feet from the edge and i 'm thinkin '
maybe six feet ai n't so far down
hold me now
i 'm six feet from the edge and i 'm thinkin '
maybe six feet ai n't so far down
i 'm so far down
sad eyes follow me
cause ' i still beleive there 's something left for me
so please come stay with me
cause ' i still beleive there 's something left for you and me
hold me now
i 'm six feet from the edge and i 'm thinkin'-thinkin'-
hold me now
i 'm six feet from the edge and i 'm thinkin '
maybe six feet ai n't so far down
hold me now
i 'm six feet from the edge and i 'm thinkin '
maybe six feet ai n't so far down
song over
if you ’ re not the one then why does my soul feel glad , today ?
if you ’ re not the one then why does my hand fit yours , this way ?
if you are not mine then why does your heart return , my call ?
if you were not mine would i have the strength to stand , at all ?
i never know what the future brings ,
but i know your here with me now ,
we ’ ll make it through and i hope you are the one i share my life with ,
i don ’ t wan na run away , but i can ’ t take it , i don ’ t understand
if i ’ m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that i am ?
is there any way that i can stay in your eyes ?
if i don ’ t need you then why am i crying on my bed ?
if i don ’ t need you then why does your name resound in my head ?
if you ’ re not for me then why does this distance maim my life ,
if your not for me then why do i dream of you , as my wife ?
i don ’ t know why you ’ re so far away ,
but i know that this much is true ,
we ’ ll make it through and i hope you are the one i share my life with ,
and i wish that you could be the one i die with ,
and i pray that you ’ re the one i build my home with ,
i hope i love you all my life .
i don ’ t wan na run away , but i can ’ t take it , i don ’ t understand
if i ’ m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that i am ?
is there any way that i can stay in your eyes ?
cos i miss you body and soul , so strong that it takes my breath away ,
and i breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today ,
cos i love you , whether its wrong or right ,
and though i can ’ t be with you tonight , you know my heart is by your side .
i don ’ t wan na run away , but i can ’ t take it , i don ’ t understand
if i ’ m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that i am ?
is there any way that i can stay in your eyes ?
song over
where is the moment when we need it the most
you kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
they tell me your blue sky 's faded to grey
the tell me your passion 's gone away
and i do n't need no carrying on
stand in the line just ahead of the law
you 're faking a smile with the coffee you go
you tell me your life 's been way off line
you 're falling to pieces everytime
and i do n't need no carrying on
cause you had a bad day
you 're taking one down
you sing a sad song just to turn it around
you say you do n't know
you tell me do n't lie
you work at a smile and you go for a ride
you had a bad day
the camera do n't lie
you 're coming back down and you really do n't mind
you had a bad day
well you need a blue sky holiday
the point is they laugh at what you say
and i do n't need no carrying on
cause you had a bad day
you 're taking one down
you sing a sad song just to turn it around
you say you do n't know
you tell me do n't lie
you work at a smile and you go for a ride
you had a bad day
the camera do n't lie
you 're coming back down and you really do n't mind
you had a bad day
sometimes the system goes on the blink
and the whole thing it turns out wrong
you might not make it back and you know
that you could be well oh that strong
well i 'm not wrong
so where is the passion when you need it the most
oh you and i
you kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
cause you had a bad day
you 're taking one down
you sing a sad song just to turn it around
you say you do n't know
you tell me do n't lie
you work at a smile and you go for a ride
you had a bad day
it seem what you like
and how does it feel for one more time
you had a bad day
had a bad day
song over
hope dangles on a string
like slow spinning redemption winding in and winding out
the shine of it has caught my eye and roped me in
so mesmerizing , so hypnotizing
i am captivated ... i am
vindicated i am selfish i am wrong i am right i swear i 'm right
i swear i knew it all along and i am flawed
but i am cleaning up so well
i am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself
so clear
like the diamond in your ring cut to mirror your intentions
oversized and overwhelmed the shine of which has caught my eye
i am certain now that i am ... .
vindicated i am selfish i am wrong i am right i swear i 'm right
i swear i knew it all along and i am flawed
but i am cleaning up so well
i am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself
so turn
up the corners of your lips
part them and feel my finger tipstrace the moment , fall forever
defense is paper thin just , one touch and i 'd be in
too deep now to ever swim against the current
- so let me slip away.. so let me slip away
so let me slip away
so let me slip against the current 2x -
vindicated i am selfish i am wrong i am right i swear i 'm right
i swear i knew it all along and i am flawed
but i am cleaning up so well
i am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself
slight hope
it dangles on a string
like slow spinning redemption ...
song over
i 've practiced this for hours , gone round and round
and now i think that i 've got it all down
and as i say it louder i love how it sounds
cause i 'm not taking the easy way out .
should n't have to give a reason why ...
it 's no surprise i wo n't be here tomorrow
i ca n't believe that i stayed till today
yeah you and i will be a tough act to follow
but i know in time we 'll find this was no surprise .
it came out like a river once i let it out
when i thought that i would n't know how
held onto it forever just pushing it down
felt so good to let go of it now
should n't have to give a reason why
it 's no surprise i wo n't be here tomorrow .
i ca n't believe that i stayed till today
there 's nothing here in this heart left to borrow
there 's nothing here in this soul left to say
do n't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
god knows we tried to find an easier way
yeah you and i will be a tough act to follow
but i know in time we 'll find this was no surprise .
our favorite place we used to go
the warm embrace that no one knows
the loving look that 's left your eyes
that 's why this comes as no , as no surprise .
if i could see the future and how this plays out
i bet it 's better than where we are now
but after going through this , it 's easier to see the reason why
it 's no surprise i wo n't be here tomorrow
i ca n't believe that i stayed till today
yeah you and i will be a tough act to follow
but i know in time we 'll find this was no surprise .
our favorite place we used to go
the warm embrace that no one knows
the loving look that 's left your eyes
but i know in time we 'll find this was no surprise .
song over
she 's watching the taxi driver and pulls away
she 's been locked up inside her apartment a hundred days
she says , yeah , he 's still coming , just a little bit late
he got stuck at the laundromat washing his cape
she 's just watching the clouds roll by and they spell her name like lois lane
and she smiles , oh the way she smiles
she 's talking to angels , counting the stars
making a wish on a passing car
sh'es dancing with strangers , falling apart
waiting for superman to pick her up
in his arms ,
in his arms
she 's out on the corner trying to catch a glimpse
she 's been chasing an answer
a sign lost in the abyss , this metropolis
she says ... yeah , he 's still coming , just a little bit late
he got stuck at the five and dime saving the day
she says ... if life was a movie , then it would n't end like this
still , she smiles , the way she smiles , yeah
she 's talking to angels , she 's counting the stars
making a wish on a passing car
she 's dancing with strangers , she 's falling apart
waiting for superman to pick her up
in his arms ,
in his arms
to lift her up and take her anywhere
show her love and climbing through the air
save her now before it 's too late tonight
and she smiles
she 's talking to angels , she 's counting the stars
making a wish on a passing car
she 's dancing with strangers , she 's falling apart
waiting for superman to pick her up
in his arms ,
in his arms
to lift her up and take her anywhere
show her love and climbing through the air
save her now before it 's too late tonight
she ’ s waiting for superman

shadows fill an empty heart
from all the things that we are
can we see beyond the scars
and make it to the dawn ?
change the colors of the sky .
the ways you made me feel alive ,
for all the things that never died ,
to make it through the night ,
love will find you .
what about now ?
what about today ?
what if you 're making me all that i was meant to be ?
what if our love never went away ?
what if it 's lost behind words we could never find ?
baby , before it 's too late ,
what about now ?
the sun is breaking in your eyes
this broken heart can still survive
shadows fade into the light .
i am by your side ,
where love will find you .
what about now ?
what about today ?
what if you 're making me all that i was meant to be ?
what if our love never went away ?
what if it 's lost behind words we could never find ?
baby , before it 's too late ,
what about now
now that we 're here ,
now that we 've come this far ,
just hold on .
there is nothing to fear ,
for i am right beside you .
for all my life ,
i am yours .
what about now ?
what about today ?
what if you 're making me all that i was meant to be ?
what if our love never went away ?
what if it 's lost behind words we could never find ?

i hung up the phone tonight ,
something happened for the first time , deep inside
it was a rush , what a rush
cause the possibility that you would ever
feel the same way about me
it 's just too much , just too much
why do i keep running from the truth
all i ever think about is you
you got me hypnotized , so mesmerized , and i just got to know
do you ever think , when you 're all alone
all that we can be , where this thing can go
am i crazy or falling in love
is it really just another crush
do you catch a breath , when i look at you
are you holding back , like the way i do
cause i 'm tryin , tryin to walk away
but i know this crush ai n't goin away , goin away
has it ever crossed your mind when we were hanging
spending time girl , are we just friends
is there more , is there more
see it 's a chance we 've got ta take
cause i believe we can make this into
something that will last , last forever , forever
do you ever think , when you 're all alone
all that we can be , where this thing can go
am i crazy or falling in love
is it really just another crush
do you catch a breath , when i look at you
are you holding back , like the way i do

you can take everything i have
you can break everything i am
like i ’ m made of glass
like i ’ m made of paper
go on and try to tear me down
i will be rising from the ground
like a skyscraper , like a skyscraper
as the smoke clears
i awaken and untangle you from me
would it make you feel better to watch me while i bleed
all my windows still are broken but i ’ m standing on my feet
you can take everything i have
you can break everything i am

you used to call me on my cell phone
late night when you need my love
call me on my cell phone
late night when you need my love
i know when that hotline bling
that can only mean one thing
i know when that hotline bling
that can only mean one thing
ever since i left the city you
got a reputation for yourself now
everybody knows and i feel left out
girl you got me down , you got me stressed out
cause ever since i left the city , you
started wearing less and goin ' out more
glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
hangin ' with some girls i 've never seen before
you used to call me on my cell phone
late night when you need my love
call me on my cell phone
late night when you need my love
i know when that hotline bling
that can only mean one thing
i know when that hotline bling
that can only mean one thing
ever since i left the city , you , you , you
you and me we just do n't get along
you make me feel like i did you wrong
going places where you do n't belong
ever since i left the city , you
you got exactly what you asked for
running out of pages in your passport
hanging with some girls i 've never seen before
you used to call me on my cell phone
late night when you need my love
call me on my cell phone
late night when you need my love
i know when that hotline bling
that can only mean one thing
i know when that hotline bling
that can only mean one thing
wonder if you bendin ' over backwards for someone else
wonder if you rolling up a backwoods for someone else
doing things i taught you gettin ' nasty for someone else
you do n't need no one else
you do n't need nobody else , no
why you never alone
why you always touching road
used to always stay at home , be a good girl
you was in the zone
you should just be yourself
right now , you 're someone else
you used to call me on my cell phone
late night when you need my love
call me on my cell phone
late night when you need my love
i know when that hotline bling
that can only mean one thing
i know when that hotline bling
that can only mean one thing

heaven and earth have finally aligned
days are good and thats they way it should be
you sprinkle star dust on my pillow case
it 's like a mooning brushed across my face
nights are good and thats the way it should be
you make sing ooohhh la la laaa
you make a girl go oohhh oohhh
i 'm in love , love
did you see that shooting star tonight ?
were you dazzled by the same constellation ?
did you and jupiter conspire to get me ?
i think you and the moon and neptune got it right
'cause now i 'm shining bright , so bright
bright , so bright
and i see colors in a different way
you make what does n't matter fade to grey
life is good and that 's the way it should be
you make sing ooohhh la la laaa
you make a girl go oohhh oohhh
i 'm in love , love
did you see that shooting star tonight ?
were you dazzled by the same constellation ?
did you and jupiter conspire to get me ?
i think you and the moon and neptune got it right
'cause now i 'm shining bright
-oooohhh- so bright
and i get lost -ooohh- in your eyes
did you see that shooting star tonight ?
were you dazzled by the same constellation ?
did you and jupiter conspire to get me ?
i think you and the moon and neptune got it right
i think you and the moon and neptune got it right
i think you and the moon and neptune got it right
'cause now i 'm shining bright , so bright
bright , so bright
bright , so bright
and i get lost in your eyes tonight
song over
she sees them walking in a straight line , that 's not really her style
and they all got the same heartbeat , but hers is falling behind
nothing in this world could ever bring them down
yeah they 're invincible and she 's just in the background
i wish that i could be like the cool kids
'cause all the cool kids , they seem to fit in
i wish that i could be like the cool kids
like the cool kids
he sees them talking with a big smile , but they have n't got a clue
yeah , they 're living the good life , ca n't see what he is going through
they 're driving fast cars , but they do n't know where they 're going
in the fast lane , living life without knowing
i wish that i could be like the cool kids
'cause all the cool kids , they seem to fit in
i wish that i could be like the cool kids
like the cool kids
i wish that i could be like the cool kids
'cause all the cool kids , they seem to get it
i wish that i could be like the cool kids
like the cool kids
i wish that i could be like the cool kids
'cause all the cool kids , they seem to fit in
i wish that i could be like the cool kids
like the cool kids
i wish that i could be like the cool kids
'cause all the cool kids , they seem to fit in
i wish that i could be like the cool kids
like the cool kidss
song over
when i was six years old i broke my leg
and i was running from my brother and his friends
and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as i rolled down
i was younger then , take me back to when i
found my heart and broke it here
made friends and lost them through the years
and i 've not seen the roaring fields in so long , i know i 've grown
but i ca n't wait to go home
i 'm on my way , driving at ninety
down those country lanes singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way you make me feel and it 's real
when we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
had my first kiss on a friday night , i do n't reckon i did it
right , i was younger then , take me back to when we found
weekend jobs and when we got paid
we 'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
me and my friends have not thrown up in so long , oh how we 've grown
but i ca n't wait to go home
i 'm on my way , driving at ninety
down those country lanes singing to tiny dancer
and i miss the way you make me feel and it 's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
one friend left to sell clothes and , one works down by the coast
one had two kids but lives alone , one 's brother overdosed
one 's already on his second wife , one 's just barely getting by but
these people raised me and i-i-i , ca n't wait to go home
and i 'm on my way , i still remember
these old country lanes when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way you make me feel and it 's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
song over
i met this girl late last year
she said do n't you worry if i disappear
i told her i 'm not really looking for another mistake
i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
but then i jump right in a week later return
i reckoned she was only looking for a lover to burn
but i gave her my time for two or three nights
then i put it on pause until the moment was right
i went away for months until our paths crossed again
she told me i was never looking for a friend
maybe you can swing by my room around 10
baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
we 'll be in between the sheets till the late am
baby if you wanted me then you should 've just said
she 's singing ah lahmlahlah do n't xxxx
with my love that heart is so cold all over my arms
i do n't want to know that name ah lahmlahlah
do n't xxxx with my love
i told her she knows take aim and reload
i do n't want to know that name ah lahmlahlah
for a couple weeks i only want to see her
we drink away the days with a take away pizza
before a text message is the only way to reach her
now she 's staying at my place and loves the way i treat her
singing out aretha all over the track like a feature
and never wants to sleep i guess that i do n't want to either
but me and her we make money the same way
four cities , two planes the same day
and those shows have never been what it 's about
maybe we 'll go together and just figure it out
i 'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
but we should get on a plane or we 'll be missing it now
wish i 'd have written it down the way that things played out
when she was kissing him how ? i was confused about
she should figure it out while i 'm sat here singing
la la do n't xxxx with my love
that heart is so cold all over my arms
i do n't want to know that name ah lahmlahlah
do n't xxxx with my love
i told her she knows take aim and reload
i do n't want to know that name ah lahmlahlah
*bang bang bang* on my hotel door
i do n't even know if she knows what for
she was crying on my shoulder i already told ya
trust and respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next
but you did n't need to take him to bed , that 's all
and i never saw him as a threat
until you disappeared with him to have xxx , of course
it 's not like we were both on tour
we were staying on the same xxxxing hotel floor
and i was n't looking for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun and i thought you were different
this is not the way you realise what you wanted
it 's a bit too much too late if i ' m honest
all this time god knows i 'm singing
la la do n't xxxx with my love
that heart is so cold all over my arms
i do n't want to know that name ah lahmlahlah
do n't xxxx with my love
i told her she knows take aim and reload
i do n't want to know that name ah lahmlahlah
la la do n't xxxx with my love
that heart is so cold all over my arms
i do n't want to know that name ah lahmlahlah
do n't xxxx with my love
i told her she knows take aim and reload
i do n't want to know that name ah lahmlahlah
song over
i 'm gon na pick up the pieces ,
and build a lego house
when things go wrong we can knock it down
my three words have two meanings ,
there 's one thing on my mind
it 's all for you
and it 's dark in a cold december , but i 've got ya to keep me warm
and if you 're broken i will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm
that 's raging on
i 'm out of touch , i 'm out of love
i 'll pick you up when you 're getting down
and out of all these things i 've done i think i love you better now
i 'm out of sight , i 'm out of mind
i 'll do it all for you in time
and out of all these things i 've done i think i love you better now
i 'm gon na paint you by numbers
and colour you in
if things go right we can frame it , and put you on a wall
and it 's so hard to say it but i 've been here before
and i 'll surrender up my heart
and swap it for yours
i 'm out of touch , i 'm out of love
i 'll pick you up when you 're getting down
and out of all these things i 've done i think i love you better now
i 'm out of sight , i 'm out of mind
i 'll do it all for you in time
and out of all these things i 've done i think i love you better now
do n't hold me down
i think my braces are breaking and it 's more than i can take
and if you 're broken i will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm
that 's raging on
i 'm out of touch , i 'm out of love
i 'll pick you up when you 're getting down
and out of all these things i 've done i think i love you better now
i 'm out of touch , i 'm out of love
i 'll pick you up when you 're getting down
and out of all these things i 've done i think i love you better now
song over
the club is n't the best place to find a lover
so the bar is where i go
me and my friends at the table doing shots
drinking faster and then we talk slow
come over and start up a conversation with just me
and trust me i 'll give it a chance now
took my hand , stop , prepare `` the man '' on the jukebox
and then we start to dance , and now i 'm singing like
girl , you know i want your love
your love was handmade for somebody like me
come on now , follow my lead
i may be crazy , do n't mind me , say
boy , let 's not talk too much
grab on my waist and put that body on me
come on now , follow my lead
come—come on now , follow my lead
i 'm in love with the shape of you
we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
i 'm in love with your body
and last night you were in my room
and now my bedsheets smell like you
every day discovering something brand new
well i 'm in love with your body
i 'm in love with your body
i 'm in love with your body
i 'm in love with your body
every day discovering something brand new
i 'm in love with the shape of you
one week in we let the story begin
we 're going out on our first date
but you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
fill up your bag and i fill up a plate
we talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
and how your family is doin ' okay
and leave and get in a taxi , we kiss in the backseat
tell the driver make the radio play , and i 'm singing like
girl , you know i want your love
your love was handmade for somebody like me
come on now , follow my lead
i may be crazy , do n't mind me , say
boy , let 's not talk too much
grab on my waist and put that body on me
come on now , follow my lead

stripped to the waist we fall into the river
cover your eyes so you do n't know the secret
i 've been trying to hide we held our breath to see our names are written
on the wreck of '86 that was the year i knew the panic was over
yes since we found out since we found out
that anything could happen anything could happen
anything could happen anything could happen
anything could happen anything could happen
anything could
after the war we said we 'd fight together i guess we thought that 's just what humans do
letting darkness grow as if we need its palette and we need its colour
but now i 've seen it through
and now i know the truth
that anything could happen anything could happen
anything could happen anything could happen
anything could happen anything could happen
anything could
baby , i 'll give you everything you need
i 'll give you everything you need , oh
i 'll give you everything you need
but i do n't think i need you
stripped to the waist we fall into the river
cover your eyes so you do n't know the secret

song over
i had a way then losing it all on my own
i had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown
and i 'm not sleeping now the dark is too hard to beat
and i 'm not keeping now the strength i need to push me
you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
you shine it when i 'm alone
and so i tell myself that i 'll be strong
and dreaming when they 're gone
'cause they 're calling , calling , calling me home
calling , calling , calling home
you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
you shine it when i 'm alone
noises , i play within my head
touch my own skin and hope that i 'm still breathing
and i think back to when my brother and my sister slept
in an unlocked place the only time i feel safe
you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
you shine it when i 'm alone
and so i tell myself that i 'll be strong
and dreaming when they 're gone
'cause they 're calling , calling , calling me home
calling , calling , calling home
you show the lights that stop me turn to stone

you 're the light , you 're the night
you 're the color of my blood
you 're the cure , you 're the pain
you 're the only thing i wan na touch
never knew that it could mean so much , so much
you 're the fear , i do n't care
'cause i 've never been so high
follow me to the dark
let me take you past our satellites
you can see the world you brought to life , to life
so love me like you do , l-l-love me like you do
love me like you do , l-l-love me like you do
touch me like you do , t-t-touch me like you do
what are you waiting for ?
fading in , fading out
on the edge of paradise
every inch of your skin
is a holy grail i 've got to find
only you can set my heart on fire , on fire
yeah , i 'll let you set the pace
'cause i 'm not thinking straight
my head spinning around i ca n't see clear no more

i ca n't buy your love , do n't even wan na try .
sometimes the truth wo n't make you happy , so i 'm not gon na lie .
but do n't ever question if my heart beats only for you , it beats only for you .
i know i 'm far from perfect , nothin ' like your entourage
i ca n't grant you any wishes , i wo n't promise you the stars .
but do n't ever question if my heart beats only for you , it beats only for you .
cause when you 've given up .
when no matter what you do it 's never good enough .
when you never thought that it could ever get this tough ,
that 's when you feel my kind of love .
and when you 're crying out .
when you fall and then ca n't pick , you 're heavy on the ground
when the friends you thought you had have n't stuck around .
that 's when you feel my kind of love .

you won ’ t find him drinking at the table
rolling dice and staying out til 3
you won ’ t ever find him being unfaithful
you will find you will find him next to me
you won ’ t find him trying to change the devil
for money fame power out of grief
you won ’ t ever find him where the rest go
you will find him find him next to me
next to me ooooh
next to me ooooh
next to me ooooh
you will find him you ’ ll find him next to me

i 'm so tired of being here
suppressed by all of my childish fears
and if you have to leave - i wish that you could just leave
because your presence still lingers here - and it wo n't leave me alone
these wounds wo n't seem to heal
this pain is just too real
there 's just too much that time can not erase
when you cried i 'd wipe away all of your tears
when you 'd scream i 'd fight away all of your fears
i held your hand through all of these years
but you still have all of me
you used to captivate me by your resonating light
but now i 'm bound by the life you left behind
your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
your voice it chased away all the sanity in me
these wounds wo n't seem to heal
this pain is just too real
there 's just too much that time can not erase
when you cried i 'd wipe away all of your tears
when you 'd scream i 'd fight away all of your fears
i held your hand through all of these years
but you still have all of me
i 've tried so hard to tell myself that you 're gone
but though you 're still with me i 've been alone all along
when you cried i 'd wipe away all of your tears
when you 'd scream i 'd fight away all of your fears
i held your hand through all of these years
but you still have all of me

you one wish

ooh , to feel the way i feel with your arms around me
i only wish that you could see
the way you love me

it 's not right
it 's not fair
what you 're missing over there
someday i 'll find a way to show you
just how lucky i am to know you

there 's love reflecting in my eyes

some legends are told
some turn to dust or to gold
but you will remember me
remember me for centuries
if just one mistake
is all it will take
we ’ ll go down in history
remember me for centuries
remember me for centuries
mummified my teenage dreams
no it 's nothing wrong with me
the kids are all wrong , the story 's all off
heavy metal broke my -heart-
come on come on and let me in
bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
this is supposed to match , the darkness that you felt
i never meant for you to fix yourself
some legends are told
some turn to dust or to gold
but you will remember me
remember me for centuries
if just one mistake
is all it will take
we ’ ll go down in history
remember me for centuries
i ca n't stop until the whole world knows my name
'cause i was only born inside my dreams
until you die for me , as long as theres a light
my shadows over you 'cause i-i- am the opposite of amnesia
and you 're a cherry blossom , you 're about to bloom
you look so pretty but you 're gone so soon
some legends are told
some turn to dust or to gold
but you will remember me
remember me for centuries
if just one mistake
is all it will take
we ’ ll go down in history
remember me for centuries
we 've been here forever
and here 's the frozen proof
i could scream forever
we are the poisoned youth

she says she 's no good with words but i 'm worse
barely stuttered out
a joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
weighed down with words too overdramatic
tonight it 's `` it ca n't get much worse ''
vs. `` no one should ever feel like ... ''
i 'm two quarters and a heart down
and i do n't want to forget how your voice sounds
these words are all i have so i 'll write them
so you need them just to get by
dance , dance
we 're falling apart to half time
dance , dance
and these are the lives you love to lead
dance , this is the way they 'd love
if they knew how misery loved me
i 'm two quarters and a heart down
and i do n't want to forget how your voice sounds
these words are all i have so i 'll write them
so you need them just to get by
why do n't you show me a little bit of spine
you 've been saving for his mattress , love
dance , dance
we 're falling apart to half time
dance , dance
and these are the lives you love to lead
dance , this is the way they 'd love

and these are the lives you love to lead
dance , this is the way they 'd love
if they knew how misery loved me
song over
oh na na na na na na na na
i never really feel a thing
i 'm just kinda too frozen
you were the only one
that even kinda came close
i just pinch myself
no longer comatose
i woke up , no luck
i woke up , no luck
and when your stitch comes loose
i wan na sleep on every piece of fuzz
and stuffing that comes out of you , you
i took too many hits off this memory
i need to come down
an-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
so hold me tight
hold me tight , or do n't
oh n-n-no , no this is n't how our story ends
so hold me tight
hold me tight , or do n't
i got too high again
realized i ca n't not be with you
or be just your friend
i love you to death
but i just ca n't , i just ca n't pretend
we were n't lovers first
confidants but never friends
were we ever friends ?
and when your stitch comes loose
i wan na sleep on every piece of fuzz
and stuffing that comes out of you , you
i took too many hits off this memory
i need to come down
an-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
so hold me tight
hold me tight , or do n't
oh n-n-no , no this is n't how our story ends
so hold me tight
hold me tight , or do n't
hold me tight , or do n't
'cause i 'm past the limits
the distance between us
it sharpens me like a knife
past the limits
the distance between us
it sharpens me like a knife
an-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
so hold me tight
hold me tight , or do n't
i 'm pretty sure that this is n't how our story ends
so hold me tight
hold me tight , or do n't
song over
im gon na make you bend and break -it sent you to me without wait-
say your prayers but let the good times roll ,
in case god does n't show -let the good times roll-
and i want these words to make things right
but its the wrongs that make the wrongs that make the words come to life
`` who does he think he is , ''
if thats the worst you got ,
then you better put your fingers back to the keys .
one night and one more time ,
thanks for the memories ,
even though they were n't so great
he tastes like you only sweeter !
one night yeah and one more time
thanks for the memories , thanks for the memories
he , he tastes like you only sweeter ! ohhhh
been looking forward to the future
but my eyesight is going bad
and this crystal ball
it 's always cloudy except for
when you look into the past -look into the past-
one night stand -one night stand off-
one night and one more time
thanks for the memories
even though they were n't so great
he tastes like you only sweeter !
one night , yeah , and one more time
thanks for the memories , thanks for the memories
he , he tastes like you only sweeter !
they say ! i only think in the form of crunching numbers
in hotel rooms , collecting page six lovers
get me out of my mind ,
and get you out of those clothes !
i 'm a liner away from getting you into the mood , whooaaahh
one night and one more time
thanks for the memories
even though they were n't so great
he tastes like you only sweeter !
one night , yeah , and one more time
thanks for the memories , thanks for the memories
he , he tastes like you only sweeter !

song over
sometimes i feel
like i am drunk behind the wheel
the wheel of possibility
how ever it may roll
give it a spin
see if you can somehow factor in
you know there 's always more than one way
to say exactly what you mean to say
was i out of my head
was i out of my mind
how could i have ever been so blind ?
i was waiting for an indication
it was hard to find
do n't matter what i say
only what i do
i never mean to do bad things to you
so quiet but i finally woke up
if you 're sad then it 's time you spoke up too
song over
the smell of your skin lingers on me now
you 're probably on your flight back to your home town
i need some shelter of my own protection baby
to be with myself and center , clarity peace , serenity
i hope you know , i hope you know
that this has nothing to do with you
it 's personal , myself and i
we 've got some straightenin ' out to do
and i 'm gon na miss you like a child misses their blanket
but i 've got to get a move on with my life
it 's time to be a big girl now
and big girls do n't cry
do n't cry , don ’ t cry , don ’ t cry ...
the path that i 'm walking , i must go alone
i must take the baby steps 'til i 'm full grown , full grown
fairytales do n't always have a happy ending , do they ?
and i foresee the dark ahead if i stay
i hope you know , i hope you know
that this has nothing to do with you
it 's personal , myself and i
we 've got some straightenin ' out to do
and i 'm gon na miss you like a child misses their blanket
but i 've got to get a move on with my life
it 's time to be a big girl now
and big girls do n't cry
like the little school mate in the school yard
we 'll play jacks and uno cards
i 'll be your best friend and you 'll be my valentine
yes you can hold my hand if you want to
'cause i want to hold yours too
we 'll be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds
but it 's time for me to go home
it 's getting late , dark outside
i need to be with myself and center , clarity peace , serenity
i hope you know , i hope you know
that this has nothing to do with you
it 's personal , myself and i
we 've got some straightenin ' out to do
and i 'm gon na miss you like a child misses their blanket
but i 've got to get a move on with my life
it 's time to be a big girl now

and now i 'm coming alive

i ca n't stand to fly
i 'm not that naive
i 'm just out to find
the better part of me
i 'm more than a bird ... i 'm more that a plane
more than some pretty face beside a train
it 's not easy to be me
wish that i could cry
fall upon my knees
find a way to lie
about a home i 'll never see
it may sound absurd ... but do n't be naive
even heroes have the right to bleed
i may be disturbed ... but wo n't you concede
even heroes have the right to dream
it 's not easy to be me
up , up ahead ... away from me
it 's all right ... you can all sleep sound tonight
i 'm not crazy ... or anything ...

but since your dad walked out your mom could use a guy like me

staring at a mapple leaf
leaning on the mother tree , i
said to myself
`` we all lost touch ''
your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
and seedless watermelon
oh , nothing from the ground is good enough
body rise
it looks over me
oh , chariot
your golden waves
are walking down upon this place
oh , chariot
i 'm singing out loud
to guide me
give me your..
remember seeing moon 's rebirth
rings made mirrors of the earth
the sun was just yellow energy
there is a living promise land
even over fields of sand
seasons fill my burden
cover me
bring it back
more than a memory
oh , chariot
your golden waves
are walking down upon this place
oh , chariot
i 'm singing out loud
to guide me
you 'll be my vacation away from this place
you know what i want
holding that cup
that 's pooring over
makes me wan na spread my arms and fly
oh , chariot
your golden waves
are walking down upon this place
oh , chariot
i 'm singing out loud
to guide me
give me your strength
-give me your strength-

-give me your strength-

dreams , that 's where i have to go
to see your beautiful face anymore
i stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
hope , hope there 's a conversation
where we both admit we had it good but
until then it 's alienation , i know , that much is understood
and i realize
if you ask me how i 'm doin i would say i 'm doin just fine
i would lie and say that you 're not on my mind
but i go out and i sit down at a table set for two
and finally i 'm forced to face the truth
no matter what they say , i 'm not over you
not over you
if you ask me how i 'm doin i would say i 'm doin just fine
i would lie and say that you 're not on my mind
but i go out and i sit down at a table set for two
and finally i 'm forced to face the truth
no matter what they say , i 'm not over you
not over you
and if i had the chance to renew
you know there is n't a thing i would n't do
i could get back on the right track
but only if you 'd be convinced
so until then
if you ask me how i 'm doin i would say i 'm doin just fine
i would lie and say that you 're not on my mind
but i go out and i sit down at a table set for two
and finally i 'm forced to face the truth
no matter what they say , i 'm not over you
not over you
not over you

home grown alligator , see you later
got ta hit the road , got ta hit the road
the sun and change in the atmosphere ,
architecture unfamiliar ,
i could get used to this
time flies by in the yellow and green ,
stick around and you ’ ll see what i mean .
there ’ s a mountain top , that i ’ m dreaming of ,
if you need me , you know where i ’ ll be .
i ’ ll be riding shotgun ,
underneath the hot sun ,
feeling like a someone .
i ’ ll be riding shotgun ,
underneath the hot sun ,
feeling like a someone .
the south of the equator , navigator ,
got ta hit the road , got ta hit the road .
deep-sea diving round the clock ,
bikini bottoms , lager tops
i could get used to this
time flies by in the yellow and green ,
stick around and you ’ ll see what i mean .
there ’ s a mountain top , that i ’ m dreaming of ,
if you need me , you know where i ’ ll be .
i ’ ll be riding shotgun ,
underneath the hot sun ,
feeling like a someone .
i ’ ll be riding shotgun ,
underneath the hot sun ,
feeling like a someone .
we got two in the front , two in the back ,
sailing along and we don ’ t look back .
time flies by in the yellow and green ,
stick around and you ’ ll see what i mean .

i remember when , i remember , i remember when i lost my mind
there was something so pleasant about that phase .
in so much space
and when you 're out there , without care ,
yeah , i was out of touch
but it was n't because i did n't know enough
i just knew too much
does that make me crazy ?
does that make me crazy ? ?
does that make me crazy ? ? ?
probably .
and i hope that you are having the time of your life
but think twice , that 's my only advice
come on now , who do you , who do you , who do you , who do you think you are ,
ha ha ha bless your soul
you really think you 're in control

i walk a lonely road , the only one that i have ever known
do n't know where it goes , but it 's home to me and i walk alone
i walk this empty street , on the boulevard of broken dreams
where the city sleeps , and i 'm the only one and i walk alone
i walk alone , i walk alone .
i walk alone , i walk a ... .
my shadow 's the only one that walks beside me
my shallow hearts the only thing that 's beating
sometimes i wish someone out there will find me
till then i walk alone
ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah ahhh-ah
haaa-ah ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah
song over
hear the sound of the falling rain
coming down like an armageddon flame - hey ! -
the shame , the ones who died without a name
hear the dogs howling out of key
to a hymn called `` faith and misery '' - hey ! -
and bleed , the company lost the war today
i beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
this is the dawning of the rest of our lives
on holiday
hear the drum pounding out of time another protestor has crossed the line - hey ! - to find , the money 's on the other side can i get another amen ? - amen ! - there 's a flag wrapped around a score of men - hey ! -

summer has come and passed
the innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends
like my fathers ' come to pass
seven years has gone so fast
wake me up when september ends
here comes the rain again
falling from the stars
drenched in my pain again
becoming who we are
as my memory rests
but never forgets what i lost
wake me up when september ends
summer has come and passed
the innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends
ring out the bells again
like we did when spring began
wake me up when september ends
here comes the rain again
falling from the stars
drenched in my pain again
becoming who we are
as my memory rests
but never forgets what i lost
wake me up when september ends
summer has come and passed
the innocent can never last
wake me up when september ends
like my father 's come to pass
twenty years has gone so fast
wake me up when september ends
wake me up when september ends
wake me up when september ends

ohh ...
got a boy back home in michigan
and it tastes like jack when i 'm kissing him
so i told him that i never really liked his friends
now he 's gone and he 's calling me a bitch again
it 's a guy that lives in a garden state
and he told me that we 'd make it 'til we graduate
so i told him the music would be worth the wait
but he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate
i believe , i believe , i believe , i believe
that we 're meant to be
but jealousy , jealousy , jealousy , jealousy
gets the best of me
look , i do n't mean to frustrate , but i
always make the same mistakes , yeah
always make the same mistakes 'cause
i 'm bad at love -ooh-ooh-
but you ca n't blame me for tryin '
you know i 'd be lyin ' sayin '
you were the one -ooh-ooh-
that could finally fix me
lookin ' at my history
i 'm bad at love
got a girl with california eyes
and i thought that she could really be the one this time
but i never got the chance to make her mine
because she fell in love with little thin white lines
london girl with an attitude
we never told no one but we look so cute
both got way better things to do
but i always think about it when i 'm riding through
i believe , i believe , i believe , i believe
that we 're meant to be
but jealousy , jealousy , jealousy , jealousy
gets the best of me
look , i do n't mean to frustrate , but i
always make the same mistakes , yeah
always make the same mistakes 'cause
i 'm bad at love -ooh-ooh-

oh , you know , you know , you know
i 'm bad at love -ooh-ooh-
i 'm bad at love -ooh-ooh-
i know that you 're afraid
i 'm gon na walk away
each time the feeling fades
each time the feeling fades
i know that you 're afraid
i 'm gon na walk away
each time the feeling fades
i 'm bad at love -ooh-ooh-

cigarettes and tiny liquor bottles ,
just what you ’ d expect inside her new balenciaga .
bad romance , turned dreams into an empire .
self-made success now she rose with rockafellas .
survival of the richest , the city ’ s ours until the fall .
they 're monaco and hampton ’ s bound but we don ’ t feel like outsiders at all .
we are the new americana ,
high on legal marijuana ,
raised on biggie and nirvana ,
we are the new americana .
young james dean , some say he looks just like his father ,
but he could never love somebody ’ s daughter .
football team loved more than just the game
so he vowed to be his husband at the alter .
survival of the richest , the city ’ s ours until the fall .
they ’ re monaco and hampton ’ s bound but we don ’ t feel like outsiders at all .
we are the new americana ,
high on legal marijuana ,
raised on biggie and nirvana ,
we are the new americana .
we know very well who we are ,
so we hold it down when summer starts .
what kind of dough have you been spending ?
what kind of bubblegum have you been blowing lately ?
we are the new americana ,
high on legal marijuana ,
raised on biggie and nirvana ,
we are the new americana .
we are the new americana -we know very well- ,
high on legal marijuana -who we are- ,
raised on biggie and nirvana -so we hold it down- ,

i fell in love , in love with you suddenly
now theres no place else i could be but here in your arms .
i like where you sleep
when you sleep next to me
i like where you sleep

to change who i used to be
and the reason is you
i 'm sorry that i hurt you
it 's something i must live with everyday
and all the pain i put you through
i wish that i could take it all away
and be the one who catches all your tears

doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo
i 'm open , your closed
where i follow you 'll go
i worry i wont see your face
light up again
even the best fall down sometime
even the wrong words seem to rhyme
out the doubt that fills my mind
i somehow find
collide
doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo
doo doo doo doo
i 'm quiet , you know
you make a first impression
i 've found i 'm scared to know i 'm always on your mind
even the best fall down sometimes
even the stars refuse to shine
out of the back you fall in time
i somehow find you and i collide
do n't stop here
i lost my place
i 'm close behind
well even the best fall down sometimes
even the wrong words seem to rhyme
out of the doubt that fills your mind
you finally find you and i collide
finally find you and i collide
you finally find you and i collide
song over
my lover 's got humour
she 's the giggle at a funeral
knows everybody 's disapproval
i should 've worshipped her sooner
if the heavens ever did speak
she is the last true mouth piece
every sunday 's getting more bleak
a fresh poison each week
'we were born sick , you heard them say it
my church offers no absolutes
she tells me 'worship in the bedroom '
the only heaven i 'll be sent to
is when i 'm alone with you
i was born sick , but i love it
aaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaamen . aaaaaaaamen . amen
take me to church
i 'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i 'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
good god , let me give you my life
take me to church
i 'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i 'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
good god , let me give you my life
no masters or kings when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
in the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
only then i am human
only then i am clean
amen . amen . amen
take me to church
i 'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i 'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
good god , let me give you my life
song over
you know i 'd fall apart without you
i do n't know how you do what you do
'cause everything that do n't make sense about me
makes sense when i 'm with you
like everything that 's green , girl i need you

put aside the math and the logic of it
you got ta know you want it too
'cause i wan na wrap you up
wan na kiss your lips
i wan na make you feel wanted
and i wan na call you mine
wan na hold you hand forever

falling like ashes to the ground , hoping my feelings , they would drown
but they never did , ever lived , ebbing and flowing , inhibited , limited

song over
when the days are cold and the cards all fold
and the saints we see
are all made of gold
when your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
are the worst of all
and the blood ’ s run stale
i want to hide the truth
i want to shelter you
but with the beast inside there ’ s nowhere we can hide
no matter what we breed
we still are made of greed
this is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come
when you feel my heat
look into my eyes
it ’ s where my demons hide it ’ s where my demons hide
don ’ t get too close
it ’ s dark inside
it ’ s where my demons hide it ’ s where my demons hide
when the curtain ’ s call is the last of all
when the lights fade out
all the sinners crawl
so they dug your grave and the masquerade
will come calling out
at the mess you made
don ’ t want to let you down
but i am hell bound
though this is all for you don ’ t want to hide the truth
no matter what we breed
we still are made of greed
this is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come
when you feel my heat
look into my eyes
it ’ s where my demons hide it ’ s where my demons hide
don ’ t get too close
it ’ s dark inside
it ’ s where my demons hide it ’ s where my demons hide
they say it 's what you make
i say it 's up to fate
it 's woven in my soul i need to let you go
your eyes , they shine so bright
i want to save their light
i ca n't escape this now unless you show me how
when you feel my heat
look into my eyes
it ’ s where my demons hide it ’ s where my demons hide

song over
i know i took the path that you would never want for me
i know i let you down , did n't i ?
so many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me
well i 'm just a slave unto the night
now remember when i told you that 's the last you 'll see of me
remember when i broke you down to tears
i know i took the path that you would never want for me
i gave you hell through all the years
so i , i bet my life , i bet my life , i bet my life on you
i , i bet my life , i bet my life , i bet my life on you
i 've been around the world but never in my wildest dreams
would i come running home to you
i 've told a million lies but now i tell a single truth
there 's you in everything i do
now remember when i told you that 's the last you 'll see of me
remember when i broke you down to tears
i know i took the path that you would never want for me
i gave you hell through all the years
so i , i bet my life , i bet my life , i bet my life on you
i , i bet my life , i bet my life , i bet my life on you
do n't tell me that i 'm wrong
i 've walked that road before and left you on your own
and please believe them when they say
that it 's left for yesterday and the records that i 've played
please forgive for all i 've done
so i , i bet my life , i bet my life , i bet my life on you
i , i bet my life , i bet my life , i bet my life on you
song over
so this is what you meant when you said that you were spent ?
and now it 's time to build from the bottom of the pit right to the top ,
packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check
i do n't ever want to let you down
i do n't ever want to leave this town
'cause after all
it 's time to begin , is n't it ?
i get a little bit bigger , but then ,
i 'll admit , i 'm just the same as i was
now do n't you understand
so this is where you fell , and i am left to sell
the path that heaven runs through miles of clouded hell ,
right to the top
turning to rags and give the commodities a rain check
i do n't ever want to let you down
i do n't ever want to leave this town
'cause after all
it 's time to begin , is n't it ?
i get a little bit bigger , but then ,
i 'll admit , i 'm just the same as i was
now do n't you understand
this road never looked so lonely ,
this house does n't burn down slowly ,
to ashes , to ashes ...
it 's time to begin , is n't it ?
i get a little bit bigger , but then ,
i 'll admit , i 'm just the same as i was
now do n't you understand
song over
will you hold the line
in this house of mine
will the stars align ?
'cause this house of mine stands strong
that 's the price you pay
leave behind your heartache , cast away
just another product of today
rather be the hunter than the prey
natural
you got ta be so cold
yeah , you 're a natural
you got ta be so cold
will somebody
what 's happenin ' ?
oh , we are the youth
a bit of the truth , the truth
that 's the price you pay
leave behind your heartache , cast away
just another product of today
rather be the hunter than the prey
natural
you got ta be so cold
yeah , you 're a natural
you got ta be so cold
deep inside me , i 'm fading to black , i 'm fading
took an oath by the blood of my hand , wo n't break it
i can taste it , the end is upon us , i swear
gon na make it
natural
you got ta be so cold
yeah , you 're a natural
you got ta be so cold
natural
yeah , you 're a natural
song over
i 'm waking up to ash and dust
i wipe my brow and i sweat my rust
i 'm breathing in the chemicals
i 'm breaking in , shaping up , then checking out on the prison bus
this is it , the apocalypse
whoa
i 'm waking up , i feel it in my bones
enough to make my systems grow
welcome to the new age , to the new age
welcome to the new age , to the new age
whoa , whoa , i 'm radioactive , radioactive
whoa , whoa , i 'm radioactive , radioactive
i raise my flags , don my clothes
it 's a revolution , i suppose
we 're painted red to fit right in
whoa

this is it , the apocalypse

i 'm waking up , i feel it in my bones
enough to make my systems grow

song over
i met you in the dark
you lit me up
you made me feel as though
i was enough
we danced the night away
we drank too much
i held your hair back when
you were throwing up
then you smiled over your shoulder
for a minute , i was stone cold sober
i pulled you closer to my chest
and you asked me to stay over
i said , i already told ya
i think that you should get some rest
i knew i loved you then
but you 'd never know
cause i played it cool when i was
scared of letting go
i know i needed you
but i never showed
but i wan na stay with you
until we 're grey and old
just say you wo n't let go
just say you wo n't let go
i wake you up with some
breakfast in bed
i 'll bring you coffee
with a kiss on your head
and i 'll take the kids to school
wave them goodbye
and i 'll thank my lucky stars for
that night
when you looked over your shoulder
for a minute , i forget that i 'm older
i wan na dance with you right now , oh
and you look as beautiful as ever
and i swear that everyday you 'll get better
you make me feel this way somehow
i 'm so in love with you
and i hope you know
darling your love is more than worth its
weight in gold
we 've come so far my dear
look how we 've grown
and i wan na stay with you
until we 're grey and old
just say you wo n't let go
just say you wo n't let go
i wan na live with you
even when we 're ghosts
cause you were always there for me
when i needed you most
i 'm gon na love you till
my lungs give out
i promise till death we part
like in our vows
so i wrote this song for you
now everybody knows
cause it 's just you and me
until we 're grey and old
just say you wo n't let go
just say you wo n't let go
just say you wo n't let go
oh , just say you wo n't let go

my life is brilliant .
my life is brilliant .
my love is pure .
i saw an angel .
of that i 'm sure .
she smiled at me on the subway .
she was with another man .
but i wo n't lose no sleep on that ,
'cause i 've got a plan .
you 're beautiful . you 're beautiful .
you 're beautiful , it 's true .
i saw your face in a crowded place ,
and i do n't know what to do .
'cause i 'll never be with you .
yeah , she caught my eye ,
as we walked on by .
she could see from my face that i was ,
xxxxing high ,
and i do n't think that i 'll see her again ,
but we shared a moment that will last till the end .
you 're beautiful . you 're beautiful .
you 're beautiful , it 's true .
i saw your face in a crowded place ,
and i do n't know what to do .
'cause i 'll never be with you .

but it 's time to face the truth ,
i will never be with you .

song over
let the geek in the pink take a stab at it
if you like the way i 'm thinkin ' baby , wink at it
i may be skinny at times but i 'm fat full of rhymes
pass me the mic and i 'm a grab at it
is n't it delicious crazy way that i 'm kissin '
'cause baby listen to this do n't wan na miss it while it 's hittin '
sometimes you got ta fit in to get in
but do n't ever quit 'cause soon i 'm gon na let you in
i do n't care what you might think about me
you get by without me if you want
i could be the one to take you home
baby i could rock the night alone
if we never get down it would n't be a let down
but sugar do n't forget what you already know
that i could be the one to turn you out
we could be the talk across the town
do n't judge me by the colour , confuse it for another
you might regret what you let slip away
like the geek in the pink
like the geek in the pink
well my relationship fodder do n't mean to bother nobody
but cupid 's automatic must of fired multiple shots at her
because she fall in love too often that 's what the matter
at least i talk about it keep a pattern of flattery
she was staring through the doorframe
eyeing me down like already a bad boyfriend
well she can get her toys out of the drawer then
'cause i ai n't comin ' home , i do n't need that attention
i do n't care what you might think about me
you get by without me if you want
i could be the one to take you home
baby i could rock the night alone
if we never get down it would n't be a let down
but sugar do n't forget what you already know
that i could be the one to turn you out
we could be the talk across the town
do n't judge me by the colour , confuse it for another
you might regret what you let slip away
hey , look at me go from zero to hero
you better take it from a geek like me
well , i can save you from unoriginal dum-dums
who would n't care if you comp -- -- lete them or not
so what i 've got a short attention span
because i 'd rather have the afternoon , relax and understand
my hip-hop and flip-flops , well it do n't stop with the light rock
my shot to mock you kinda puts me in the tight spot
the hype is nothing more than hoo-hah
so i 'm developing a language and i 'm calling it my own
so take a peek into the speaker and you 'll see what i mean
that on the other side the grass is greener
i do n't care what you might think about me
you get by without me if you want
i could be the one to take you home
baby i could rock the night alone
if we never get down it would n't be a let down
but sugar do n't forget what you already know
that i could be the one to turn you out
we could be the talk across the town
do n't judge me by the colour , confuse it for another
you might regret what you let slip away
like the geek in the pink
well , i 'm the geek in the pink y'all #
geek is the colour for all
i 'm the geek in the pink
so i ’ m the geek y ’ all
in the pink y ’ all ’
geek is the colour for all
i 'm the geek in the pink
song over
when i look into your eyes
it 's like watching the night sky
or a beautiful sunrise
there 's so much they hold
and just like them old stars
i see that you 've come so far
to be right where you are
how old is your soul ?
i wo n't give up on us
even if the skies get rough
i 'm giving you all my love
i 'm still looking up
and when you 're needing your space
to do some navigating
i 'll be here patiently waiting
to see what you find
'cause even the stars they burn
some even fall to the earth
we 've got a lot to learn
god knows we 're worth it
no , i wo n't give up
i do n't wan na be someone who walks away so easily
i 'm here to stay and make the difference that i can make
our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
the tools and gifts we got yeah , we got a lot at stake
and in the end , you 're still my friend at least we did intend
for us to work we did n't break , we did n't burn
we had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
i had to learn what i 've got , and what i 'm not
and who i am
i wo n't give up on us
even if the skies get rough
i 'm giving you all my love
i 'm still looking up
i wo n't give up on us
even if the skies get rough
i 'm giving you all my love
i 'm still looking up
i wo n't give up on us
even if the skies get rough
i 'm giving you all my love
i 'm still looking up
song over
well , you done done me and you bet i felt it
i tried to be chill but you ’ re so hot that i melted
i fell right through the cracks , and i ’ m trying to get back
before the cool done run out i ’ ll be giving it my best test
and nothing ’ s gon na stop me but divine intervention
i reckon it 's again my turn to win some or learn some
but i wo n't hesitate no more ,
no more , it can not wait i ’ m yours
well open up your mind and see like me
open up your plans and damn you 're free
look into your heart and you 'll find love love love love
listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
we are just one big family
it ’ s your god forsaken right to be loved , loved , loved , loved
so , i wo n't hesitate no more ,
no more , it can not wait i ’ m sure
there ’ s no need to complicate our time is short
this is our fate , i ’ m yours
i 've been spending ' way too long checking ' my tongue in the mirror
and bending ' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
my breath fogged up the glass
and so i drew a new face and laughed
i guess what i 'm a saying ’ s there isn ’ t no better reason
to rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
it ’ s what we aim to do
our name is our virtue
but i wo n't hesitate no more ,
no more , it can not wait i ’ m yours
well open up your mind and see like me
open up your plans and damn you 're free
look into your heart and you 'll find , that the sky is yours
song over
i saw fireworks from the freeway
and behind closed eyes i can not make them go away
cause you were born on the fourth of july , freedom ring
well something on the surface it stinks
i said something on the surface , well it kind of makes me nervous
who says that you deserve this and what kind of god would serve this ?
we will cure this dirty old disease
well if you 've got the poison i 've got the remedy
the remedy is the experience
this is a dangerous liaison
i say the comedy is that its serious
this is a strange enough new play on words
i say the tragedy is how you 're gon na spend
the rest of your nights with the light on
so shine the light on all of your friends
well it all amounts to nothing in the end .
i -- - i wont worry my life away . hey , oh oh .
i -- - i wont worry my life away . hey , oh oh .
i heard two men talking on the radio
in a cross fire kind of new reality show
uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
they were counting down the days to stab the brother in the

where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast
this catastrophy , dance with me
because if you 've got the poison , i 've got the remedy

was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me
oh things are gon na happen naturally
oh taking your advice and i 'm looking on the bright side
and balancing the whole thing
oh but often times those words they get tangled up in lines
and the bright light turns to night
oh until the dawn it brings another day to sing
about the magic that was you and me
cause you and i both loved
what you and i spoke of
and others just read of
others only read of the love
of the love that i love

and if you could see me now oh love love

and with this silence brings a moral story
more importantly evolving is the glory of a boy

song over
so much pressure , why so loud
if you do n't like my sound you can turn it down
i got ta roll , and i walk it alone
uphill battle , i look good when i climb
i 'm ferocious , precocious i get braggadocious
i 'm not gon na stop , i like the view from the top
you talk that blah blah
and i 'm so done , i 'm so over it
sometimes i mess up , i `` eff '' up , i hit and miss
but i 'm okay , i 'm cool with it
i still fall on my face sometimes
and i , ca n't colour inside the lines
cause , i 'm perfectly incomplete
i 'm still working on my masterpiece
and i , i wan na hang with the greatest
got a way to go , but it 's worth the wait
no , you have n't seen the best of me
i 'm still working on my masterpiece
oh o , oh o
oh o a ah
oh o , oh o
oh o a ah
those who mind , do n't matter
if you do n't catch what i 'm throwing
do n't need a flash
and i am leaving like that
you talk that blah blah
but with the punches i take the hits
￼sometimes i mess up , i `` eff '' up , i swing and miss
but i 'm okay , i 'm cool with it
i still fall on my face sometimes
and i , ca n't colour inside the lines
cause , i 'm perfectly incomplete
i 'm still working on my masterpiece

'cause all that 's left has gone away
and there 's nothing there for you to prove
oh , look what you 've done
you 've made a fool of everyone
oh well , it seems likes such fun
until you lose what you had won hoo

'cause i just ca n't think for you
i can hardly hear you say
what should i do , well you choose
oh , look what you 've done
you 've made a fool of everyone
oh well , it seems likes such fun
until you lose what you had won

song over
cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights
trying to keep it clear , but i ’ m losing it here to the twilight
there ’ s a dead end to my left , there ’ s a burning bush to my right
you aren ’ t in sight
you aren ’ t in sight
do you want me , like i want you or am i standing still
beneath the darkened sky , or am i standing still
with the scenery flying by , or am i standing still
out of the corner of my eye , was that you passing me by
mothers on the stoop , boys in souped-up coupes , on this hot summer night .
between fight and flight , is the blind man ’ s sight , and a choice that ’ s right .
i roll the window down , feel like i ’ m gon na drown , in this strange town .
feel broken down i feel broken down
do you need me , like i need you or am i standing still
beneath the darkened sky , or am i standing still
with the scenery flying by , or am i standing still
out of the corner of my eye , was that you passing me by
do you love me , like i love you or am i standing still
beneath the darkened sky , or am i standing still
with the scenery flying by , or am i standing still
out of the corner of my eye , was that you passing me by
are you paaaaaaaaassing me by ? -passing me by-
do you need me , like i need you too ?
and do you want me like i want you ?
are you passing me by -x2- -or am i standing still-
song over
what would i do without your smart mouth
drawing me in , and kicking me out
got my head spinning , no kidding , i cant pin you down
whats going on in that beautiful mind
im on your magical mystery ride
and im so dizzy , dont know what hit me , but ill be alright
my heads under water
but im breathing fine
youre crazy and im out of my mind
cause all of me
loves all of you
love your curves and all your edges
all your perfect imperfections
give your all to me
ill give my all to you
youre my end and my beginning
even when i lose im winning
cause i give you all , all of me
and you give me all , all of you , oh
how many times do i have to tell you
even when youre crying you ’ re beautiful too
the world is beating you down , im around through every move
youre my downfall , youre my muse
my worst distraction , my rhythm and blues
i cant stop singing , its ringing , in my head for you
cards on the table
were both showing hearts
risking it all , though its hard
cause i give you all , all of me
and you give me all , all of you , oh
song over
i know a girl
she puts the color inside of my world
she 's just like a maze
where all of the walls all continually change
i 've done all i can
to stand on the steps with my heart in my hands
now i ’ m starting to see
maybe it ’ s got nothing to do with me
so fathers be good to your daughters ,
daughters will love like you do ,
girls become lovers who turn into mothers
so mothers be good to your daughters too
oh you see that skin
its the same she ’ s been standing in
since the day she saw him walkin ’ away
now she ’ s left cleaning up the mess he made
so fathers be good to your daughters ,
daughters will love like you do ,
girls become lovers who turn into mothers
so mothers be good to your daughters too
boys you can break
find out how much they can take
boys will be strong and
boys soldier on
but boys would be gone
on behalf of every man
looking out for every girl
you are the god and the weight of her world
so fathers be good to your daughters ,
daughters will love like you do ,
girls become lovers who turn into mothers
so mothers be good to your daughters too
so mothers be good to your daughters too
so mothers be good to your daughters too
song over
i was born in the arms of imaginary friends
free to roam , made a home out of everywhere i 've been
then you come crashing in
like the realest thing
trying my best to understand all that your love can bring
oh , half of my heart 's got a grip on the situation
half of my heart takes time
half of my heart 's got the right mind to tell you that
i can ` t keep loving you
oh , half of my heart
i was made to believe i 'd never love somebody else
i made a plan , stayed the man who can only love himself
lonely was the song i sang
'til the day you came
showing me a better way and all that my love can bring
oh , half of my heart 's got a grip on the situation
half of my heart takes time
half of my heart 's got the right mind to tell you that
i can ` t keep loving you
oh , half of my heart with half of my heart
your faith is strong
but i can only fall so far so long
time to hold , later on
you will hate that i never gave more to you
than half of my heart
but i ca n't stop loving you
but i ca n't stop loving you
but i ca n't stop loving you
with half of my , half of my heart
oh , half of my heart
half of my heart 's got a real good imagination
half of my heart 's got you
half of my heart 's got a right mind to tell you
that half of my heart wo n't do
half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
half of my heart is the part of a man who 's never
truly loved anything
oh , half of my heart
oh , half of my heart
half of my heart
oh , half of my heart
half of my heart
oh , half of my heart
half of my heart
song over
lightning strikes
inside , my chest to keep me up at night
dream of ways
to make you understand my pain
clouds of sulfur in the air
bombs are falling everywhere
it 's heartbreak warfare
once you want it to begin ,
no one really ever wins
in heartbreak warfare
if you want more love ,
why do n't you say so ?
if you want more love ,
why do n't you say so ?
drop his name
push it in and twist the knife again
watch my face
as i pretend to feel no pain
clouds of sulfur in the air
bombs are falling everywhere
it 's heartbreak warfare
once you want it to begin ,
no one really ever wins
in heartbreak warfare .
if you want more love ,
why do n't you say so ?
if you want more love ,
why do n't you say so ?
just say so ...
how come the only way to know how high you get me
is to see how far i fall
god only knows how much i 'd love you if you let me
but i ca n't break through at all .
it 's a heartbreak ...
i do n't care if we do n't sleep at all tonight
let 's just fix this whole thing now
i swear to god we 're gon na get it right
if you lay your weapon down
red wine and ambien
you 're talking *xxxx* again , it 's heartbreak warfare
good to know it 's all a game
disappointment has a name , it 's heartbreak , heartbreak .
song over
take out all you ’ re wasted honour
every little past frustration
take all of you ’ re so called problems
better put them in quotations
say what you need to say
say what you need to say ... - x4 -
say what you need to say
say what you need to say ... - x4 -
have no fear for givin in
have no fear for givin all of it
you better know that in the end
its better you say too much
than never to say what you need to say again
even if your hands are shakin
and you ’ re faith is breakin
even as the eyes are closin
do it with a heart wide open .why
say what you need to say
say what you need to say ... - x4 -
song over
me and all my friends , we 're all misunderstood .
they say we stand for nothing , and theres no way we ever could .
now we see everything thats going wrong with the world and those who lead it
we just feel like we do n't have the means to rise above and beat it .
so we keep waiting ,
waiting on the world to change .
we keep on waiting ,
waiting on the world to change .
it 's hard to beat the system , when you 're standing at a distance ,
so we keep waiting ,
waiting on the world to change .
now if we had the power to bring our neighbors home from war
they would have never missed a christmas , no more ribbons on their door
and when you trust your television , what you get is what you got
cause when they own the information , oh , they can bend it all they want
that 's why we 're waiting
waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting
waiting on the world to change
it 's not that we do n't care , we just know that the fight ai n't fair
so we keep on waiting
waiting on the world to change
and we 're still waiting
waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting
waiting on the world to change
one day our generation , is gon na rule the population
so we keep on waiting
waiting on the world to change
now we keep on waiting
waiting on the world to change
we keep on waiting ,
waiting on the world to change .
waiting on the world to change
waiting on the world to change
waiting on the world to change
waiting on the world to change

song over
called her for the first time yesterday
finally found the missing part of me
felt so close but you were far away
left me without anything to say
now i 'm speechless , over the edge , i 'm just breathless
i never thought that i 'd catch this love bug again
hopeless , head over heels in the moment
i never thought that i 'd get hit by this love bug again
i ca n't get your smile out of my mind
i think about your eyes all the time
you 're beautiful but you do n't even try
modesty is just so hard to find
now i 'm speechless , over the edge , i 'm just breathless
i never thought that i 'd catch this love bug again
hopeless , head over heels in the moment
i never thought that i 'd get hit by this love bug again
kissed her for the first time yesterday
everything i wished that it would be
suddenly you forgot how to speak .
hopeless , breathless baby ca n't you see ?

and every time you told my opinion was wrong
and tried to make me forget where i came from
and i did n't wan na write a song cause i did n't want anyone thinking i still care
i do n't but , you still hit my phone up
and baby i be movin ' on and i think you should be somethin '
i do n't wan na hold back , maybe you should know that
my mama do n't like you and she likes everyone
and i never like to admit that i was wrong
and i 've been so caught up in my job , did n't see what 's going on
and now i know , i 'm better sleeping on my own
cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i 'm still holdin ' on to somethin '
you should go and love yourself
for all the times you made me feel small
i fell in love , now i feel nothin ' at all
i never felt so low when i was vulnerable
was i a fool to let you break down my walls ?
cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i 'm still holdin ' on to somethin '
you should go and love yourself
cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i 'm still holdin ' on to somethin '
you should go and love yourself

i got this feeling inside my bones
it goes electric , wavey when i turn it on
all through my city , all through my home
we 're flying up , no ceiling , when we in our zone
i got that sunshine in my pocket
got that good soul in my feet
i feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
i ca n't take my eyes up off it , moving so phenomenally
room on lock , the way we rock it , so do n't stop
and under the lights when everything goes
nowhere to hide when i 'm getting you close
when we move , well , you already know
so just imagine , just imagine , just imagine
nothing i can see but you when you dance , dance , dance
a feeling good , good , creeping up on you
so just dance , dance , dance , come on
all those things i should n't do

you were my sun
you were my earth
but you did n't know all the ways i loved you , no
so you took a chance
and made other plans
but i bet you did n't think that they would come crashing down , no
you do n't have to say , what you did ,
i already know , i found out from him
now there 's just no chance , for you and me , there 'll never be
and do n't it make you sad about it
you told me you loved me
why did you leave me , all alone
now you tell me you need me
when you call me , on the phone
girl i refuse , you must have me confused
with some other guy
to cry
cry me a river
cry me a river-er
cry me a river
cry me a river-er , yea yea

are n't you somethin ' to admire , cause your
shine is somethin ' like a mirror
and i ca n't help but notice , you reflect in this heart of mine
if you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to find
just know that i 'm always peering out on the other side
cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
i can tell you there 's no place we could n't go
just put your hand on the past , i 'm here tryin ' to pull you through
you just got ta be strong
cause i do n't wan na lose you now
i 'm lookin ' right at the other half of me
the biggest seat is set in my heart
there 's a space , but now you 're home
show me how to fight for now
and i 'll tell you baby , it was easy
comin ' back into you once i figured it out
you were right here all along
it 's like you 're my mirror
-oh oh- my mirror staring back at me
i could n't get any bigger
-oh oh- with anyone else beside of me
and now it 's clear as this promise
that we 're making two reflections into one
cause it 's like you 're my mirror
-oh oh- my mirror staring back at me , staring back at me
are n't you somethin ' an original cause it does n't seem we 'll make a sample
and i ca n't help but stare cause i see truth somewhere in your eyes
ooh i ca n't ever change without you , you reflect me , i love that about you
and if i could , i would look at us all the time
cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soap
i can tell you there 's no place we could n't go
just put your hand on the past , i 'm here tryin ' to pull you through
you just got ta be strong
cause i do n't wan na lose you now
i 'm lookin ' right at the other half of me

said all i want from you is to see you tomorrow
and every tomorrow , maybe you ’ ll let me borrow your heart
and is it too much to ask for every sunday
and while we 're at it , throw in every other day to start
i know people make promises all the time
then they turn right around and break them
when someone cuts your heart open with a knife , and you 're bleeding
but i could be that guy to heal it over time
and i won ’ t stop until you believe it
cause baby you ’ re worth it
so do n't act like it ’ s a bad thing to fall in love with me

spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
so do n't act like it ’ s a bad thing to fall in love with me

and every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
every morning i just wan na see you staring back at me
cause i know that ’ s a good place to start
i know people make promises all the time

song over
do you ever feel like a plastic bag ,
drifting through the wind
wanting to start again ?
do you ever feel , feel so paper thin
like a house of cards ,
one blow from caving in ?
do you ever feel already buried deep ?
6 feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
do you know that there 's still a chance for you
'cause there 's a spark in you
you just got ta ignite , the light , and let it shine
just own the night like the 4th of july
'cause baby you 're a firework
come on , show 'em what you 're worth
make 'em go `` oh , oh , oh ''
as you shoot across the sky-y-y
baby , you 're a firework
come on , let your colors burst
make 'em go `` oh , oh , oh ''
you 're gon na leave 'em falling down-own-own
you just got ta ignite , the light , and let it shine
just own the night like the 4th of july
'cause baby you 're a firework
come on , show 'em what you 're worth
make 'em go `` oh , oh , oh ''
as you shoot across the sky-y-y
baby , you 're a firework
come on , let your colors burst
make 'em go `` oh , oh , oh ''
you 're gon na leave 'em falling down-own-own
boom , boom , boom
even brighter than the moon , moon , moon
it 's always been inside of you , you , you
and now it 's time to let it through-ough-ough
'cause baby you 're a firework
come on , show 'em what you 're worth
make 'em go `` oh , oh , oh ''

you 're hot then you 're cold
you 're yes then you 're no
you 're in and you 're out
you 're up and you 're down
someone call the doctor
got a case of a love bi-polar
stuck on a roller coaster
ca n't get off this ride
you change your mind
like a girl changes clothes
cause you 're hot then you 're cold
you 're yes then you 're no
you 're in then you 're out
you 're up then you 're down
you 're wrong when it 's right
it 's black and it 's white
we fight , we break up
we kiss , we make up
-you-you do n't really want to stay , no
-but you-but you do n't really want to go-o
you 're hot then you 're cold
you 're yes then you 're no
you 're in and you 're out
you 're up and you 're down
song over
this was never the way i planned ,
not my intention .
i got so brave , drink in hand ,
lost my discretion .
it 's not what i 'm used to ,
just want to try you on .
i 'm curious , for you ,
caught my attention .
i kissed a girl ,
and i liked it .
the taste of her cherry chapstick .
i kissed a girl ,
just to try it .
i hope my boyfriend do n't mind it .
it felt so wrong ,
it felt so right .
do n't mean i 'm in love tonight .
i kissed a girl ,
and i liked it .
i liked it
song over
days like this i want to drive away
pack my bags and watch your shadow fade

but that was then and this is now
now look at me
this is the part of me that you 're never gon na ever take away from me , no
this is the part of me that you 're never gon na ever take away from me , no
throw your sticks and your stones
throw your bombs and your blows - but you 're not gon na break my soul
this is the part of me that you 're never gon na ever take away from me , no
i just wan na throw my phone away
find out who is really there for me
you ripped me off , your love was cheap
was always tearing at the seams
i fell deep , you let me down
but that was then and this is now - break - now look at me

song over
i used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
scared to rock the boat and make a mess
so i sat quietly , agreed politely
i let you push me past the breaking point
i stood for nothing , so i fell for everything
you held me down , but i got up
already brushing off the dust
you hear my voice , you hear that sound
like thunder , gon na shake your ground
you held me down , but i got up
get ready cause i 've had enough
i see it all , i see it now
i got the eye of the tiger , the fighter ,
cause i am a champion and you 're gon na hear me roar
cause i am a champion and you 're gon na hear me roar
oh oh oh ... , oh oh oh ... , oh oh oh ...
you 're gon na hear me roar
now i 'm floatin ' like a butterfly
stingin ' like a bee i earned my stripes
i went from zero , to my own hero
you held me down , but i got up
already brushing off the dust
you hear my voice , you hear that sound
like thunder , gon na shake your ground
you held me down , but i got up
get ready cause i 've had enough
i see it all , i see it now
i got the eye of the tiger , the fighter ,

you think i 'm pretty , without any make-up on
you think i 'm funny , when i tell the punch line wrong
i know you get me , so i 'll let my walls come
down , down
before you met i was a wreck , but
things were kinda heavy , you brought me to life , now
every february , you 'll be my
valentine , valentine
let 's go all , the way tonight
no regrets , just love
we can dance , until we die
you and i , we 'll be young forever
you make me feel like i 'm living a
teenage dream , the way you turn me on
i ca n't sleep let 's runaway
and do n't ever look back , do n't ever look back
my heart stops , when you look at me
just one touch , now baby i believe
this is real , so take a chance
and do n't ever look back , do n't ever look back
we drove to cali , and got drunk on the beach
got a motel and , built a floor out of sheets
i finally found you , my missing puzzle
piece , i 'm complete
let 's go all , the way tonight
no regrets , just love
we can dance , until we die
you and i , we 'll be young forever

be your teenage dream tonight
you make me feel like i 'm living a
teenage dream , the way you turn me on

song over
summer after high school when we first met
we make out in you mustang to radio head
and on my 18th birthday we bought matching tattoos
used to steal your parent 's liquor and climb to the roof
talk about our future like we had a clue
never planned that one day i 'd be losing you
in another life i would be your girl
we keep all our promises be us against the world
in another life i would make you stay
so i do n't have to say you were the one that got away the one that got away
i was june you were my johnny cash
never one without the other we made a pact
sometimes when i miss you i put those records on woah
someone said you had your tattoo removed
saw you down town singin ’ the blues
it 's time to face the music i 'm no longer your muse
in another life i would be your girl
we keep all our promises be us against the world
in another life i would make you stay
so i do n't have to say you were the one that got away the one that got away
the one the one the one the one that got away
all his money ca n't buy me a time machine no
ca n't replace you with a million rings no
i shoulda told you what you meant to me woah
cause now i pay the price
in another life i would be your girl
we keep all our promises be us against the world
in another life i would make you stay
so i do n't have to say you were the one that got away the one that got away
the one the one the one
in another life i would make you stay
so i do n't have to say you were the one that got away e -- -- - strum once and let it ring - the one that got away
song over
comparisons are easily done
once you 've had a taste of perfection
like an apple hanging from a tree
i picked the ripest one
i still got the seed
you said move on
where do i go
i guess second best
is all i will know
cause when i 'm with him
i am thinking of you
thinking of you
what you would do if
you were the one
who was spending the night
oh i wish that i
was looking into your eyes
you 're like an indian summer
in the middle of winter
like a hard candy
with a surprise center
how do i get better
once i 've had the best
tons of fish in the water
so the waters i will test
he kissed my lips
i taste your mouth
he pulled me in
i was disgusted with myself
cause when i 'm with him
i am thinking of you
thinking of you
what you would do if
you were the one
who was spending the night
oh i wish that i
was looking into ...
you 're the best
and yes i do regret
how i could let myself
let you go
now the lesson 's learned
i touched it i was burned
oh i think you should know
cause when i 'm with him
i am thinking of you
thinking of you
what you would do if
you were the one
who was spending the night
oh i wish that i
was looking into your eyes
looking into your eyes
looking into your eyes
oh wo n't you walk through
and burst in the door
and take me away
oh no more mistakes
cause in your eyes i 'd like to stay ...
stay ... .
song over
oh no , did i get too close ? oh ,
did i almost see what 's really on the inside ?
all your insecurities
all the dirty laundry
never made me blink one time
unconditional , unconditionally
i will love you unconditionally
there is no fear now
let go and just be free
i will love you unconditionally
come just as you are to me
do n't need apologies
know that you are worthy
i 'll take your bad days with your good
walk through this storm i would
i 'd do it all because i love you ,
unconditional , unconditionally
i will love you unconditionally
there is no fear now
let go and just be free
i will love you unconditionally
so open up your heart and just let it begin
open up your heart , and just let it begin
open up your heart , and just let it begin
open up your heart
acceptance is the key to be
to be truly free
will you do the same for me ?
unconditional , unconditionally
i will love you unconditionally
and there is no fear now
let go and just be free
cause i will love you unconditionally -oh yeah-
i will love you -unconditionally-
i will love you
i will love you unconditionally
song over
i 'm wide awake
i 'm wide awake
i 'm wide awake
yeah , i was in the dark
i was falling hard
with an open heart
i 'm wide awake
how did i read the stars so wrong
i 'm wide awake
and now it 's clear to me
that everything you see
ai n't always what it seems
i 'm wide awake
yeah , i was dreaming for so long
i wish i knew then
what i know now
would n't dive in
would n't bow down
gravity hurts
you made it so sweet
till i woke up on
on the concrete
falling from cloud 9
crashing from the high
i 'm letting go tonight
- yeah i 'm - falling from cloud 9
i 'm wide awake
not losing any sleep
i picked up every piece
and landed on my feet
i 'm wide awake
need nothing to complete myself - nooohooo
i 'm wide awake
yeah , i am born again
outta the lion 's den
i do n't have to pretend
and it 's too late
the story 's over now , the end
i wish i knew then
what i know now
would n't dive in
would n't bow down
gravity hurts
you made it so sweet
till i woke up on
on the concrete
falling from cloud 9
crashing from the high
i 'm letting go tonight - yeah , i 'm letting go -
i 'm falling from cloud 9
thunder rumbling
castles crumbling
i am trying to hold on
god knows that i tried
seeing the bright side
but i 'm not blind anymore ...
i 'm wide awake
i 'm wide awake
yeah , i 'm falling from cloud 9
crashing from the high
you know i 'm letting go tonight
i 'm falling from cloud 9
i 'm wide awake
i 'm wide awake
i 'm wide awake
i 'm wide awake
i 'm wide awake
song over
i walked across an empty land
i knew the pathway like the back of my hand
i felt the earth beneath my feet
sat by the river and it made me complete
oh si'mple thing where have you gone
i 'm getting old and i need something to rely on
so tell me when youre gon na let me in
i 'm getting tired and i need somewhere to begin
i came across a fallen tree
i felt the branches of it looking at me
is this the place we used to love ?
is this the place that ive been dreaming of ?
oh si'mple thing where have you gone
i 'm getting old and i need something to rely on
so tell me when youre gon na let me in
i 'm getting tired and i need somewhere to begin
so if you have a minute why dont we go
talk about it somewhere only we know
this could be the end of everything
so why dont we go
somewhere only we know ?
somewhere only we know
oh si'mple thing where have you gone ?
i 'm getting old and i need something to rely on
so tell me when youre gon na let me in
i 'm getting tired and i need somewhere to begin
and if you have a minute why dont we go
talk about it somewhere only we know ?
this could be the end of everything
so why dont we go , so why dont we go
this could be the end of everything
so why dont we go
somewhere only we know
somewhere only know
somewhere only we know
song over
remember all the things we wanted
now all our memories , they 're haunted
we were always meant to say goodbye
even with our fists held high
it never would 've worked out right
we were never meant for do or die
i did n't want us to burn out
i did n't come here to hold you
i want you to know that it does n't matter where we take this road
someone 's got ta go
i want you to know you could n't have loved me better
but i want you to move on
so i 'm already gone
you know that i love you so i
love you enough
i want you to know that it does n't matter where we take this road
someone 's got ta go
i want you to know you could n't have loved me better
but i want you to move on
so i 'm already gone
i 'm already gone
already gone
you ca n't make it feel right when you know that it 's wrong
i 'm already gone
already gone
there 's no moving on
so i 'm already gone
remember all the things we wanted
now all our memories , they 're haunted
we were always meant to say goodbye
i want you to know that it does n't matter where we take this road
someone 's got ta go
i want you to know you could n't have loved me better

song over
seems like just yesterday
you were a part of me
i used to stand so tall
i use to be so strong
your arms around me tight
everything , it felt so right
unbreakable , like nothin ' could go wrong
now i ca n't breathe
no , i ca n't sleep
i 'm barely hangin ' on
here i am , once again
i 'm torn into pieces
ca n't deny , ca n't pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up , deep inside
but you wo n't got to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes
i told you everything
opened up and let you in
you made me feel alright
for once in my life
now all that 's left of me
is what i pretend to be
so together , but so broken up inside
'cause i ca n't breathe
no , i ca n't sleep
i 'm barely hangin ' on
here i am , once again
i 'm torn into pieces
ca n't deny , ca n't pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up , deep inside
but you wo n't got to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes
swallow me then spit me out
for hating you , i blame myself
seeing you it kills me now
no , i do n't cry on the outside
anymore… anymore ...
here i am , once again
i 'm torn into pieces
ca n't deny , ca n't pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up , deep inside
but you wo n't got to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes
here i am , once again
i 'm torn into pieces
ca n't deny , ca n't pretend
just thought you were the one
broken up , deep inside
but you wo n't got to see the tears i cry
behind these hazel eyes

grew up in a small town
and when the rain would fall down
i 'd just stare out my window
dreaming of what could be
and if i 'd end up happy
i would pray -i would pray-
trying hard to reach out
but when i tried to speak out
felt like no one could hear me
wanted to belong here
but something felt so wrong here
so i prayed
i could breakaway
i 'll spread my wings and i 'll learn how to fly
i 'll do what it takes till i touch the sky
and i 'll make a wish , take a chance , make a change
and breakaway
out of the darkness and into the sun
but i wo n't forget all the ones that i loved
i 'll take a risk , take a chance , make a change
and breakaway

travel on a jet plane

buildings with a hundred floors
swinging round revolving doors
maybe i do n't know where they 'll take me but
got ta keep moving on , moving on
fly away
breakaway
i 'll spread my wings and i 'll learn how to fly
though it 's not easy to tell you goodbye
i got ta make a wish , take a chance , make a change

out of the darkness and into the sun
but i wo n't forget of the place i come from
i got ta take a risk , take a chance , make a change

song over
i do n't wan na be left behind
distance was a friend of mine
catching breath in a web of lies
i 've spent most of my life
riding waves playing acrobat
shadowboxing the other half
learning how.. to react
i 've spent most of my time
catching my breath , letting it go
turning my cheek for the sake of the show
now that you know this is my life
i wo n't be told what 's supposed to be right -ca ca ca ca ca ca ca-
catch my breath
no one can hold me back
i ai n't got time for that -ca ca ca ca ca ca ca-
catch my breath
wo n't let them get me down
it 's all so simple now
addicted to the love i found
heavy heart now a weightless cloud
making time for the ones that count
i 'll spend the rest of my time
laughing hard with the windows down
leaving footprints all over town
keeping faith kinda comes around
and i ’ ve spent the rest of my life
catching my breath , letting it go
turning my cheek for the sake of the show
now that you know this is my life
i wo n't be told what 's supposed to be right -ca ca ca ca ca ca ca-
catch my breath
no one can hold me back
i ai n't got time for that -ca ca ca ca ca ca ca-

wo n't let them get me down

you helped me see
the beauty
in everything !
catching my breath , letting it go
turning my cheek for the sake of the show

i wo n't be told what 's supposed to be right !
catching my breath , letting it go
turning my cheek for the sake of the show

there 's a place that i know
it 's not pretty there and few have ever gone
if i show it to you now
will it make you run away
or will you stay
even if it hurts
even if i try to push you out
will you return ?
and remind me who i really am
please remind me who i really am
everybody 's got a dark side
do you love me ?
can you love mine ?
nobody 's a picture perfect
but we 're worth it
you know that we 're worth it
will you love me ?
even with my dark side ?
like a diamond
from black dust
it 's hard to know
if you give up
so do n't give up on me
please remind me who i really am

song over
you know the bed feels warmer
sleeping here alone
you know i dream in colour
and do the things i want
you think you got the best of me
think you had the last laugh
bet you think that everything good is gone
think you left me broken down
think that i 'd come running back
baby you do n't know me , cause you 're dead wrong
what does n't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
does n't mean i 'm lonely when i 'm alone
what does n't kill you makes a fighter
footsteps even lighter
does n't mean i 'm over cause you 're gone
what does n't kill you makes you stronger , stronger
just me , myself and i
what does n't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
does n't mean i 'm lonely when i 'm alone
you heard that i was starting over with someone new
but told you i was moving on over you
you did n't think that i 'd come back
i 'd come back swinging
you tried to break me , but you see
what does n't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
does n't mean i 'm lonely when i 'm alone
what does n't kill you makes a fighter
footsteps even lighter
does n't mean i 'm over cause you 're gone
what does n't kill you makes you stronger , stronger
just me , myself and i
what does n't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
does n't mean i 'm lonely when i 'm alone
thanks to you i got a new thing started
thanks to you i 'm not a broken hearted
thanks to you i 'm finally thinking bout me
you know in the end the day you left was just my beginning
in the end ...
what does n't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
does n't mean i 'm lonely when i 'm alone
what does n't kill you makes a fighter
footsteps even lighter
does n't mean i 'm over cause you 're gone
what does n't kill you makes you stronger , stronger
just me , myself and i
what does n't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
does n't mean i 'm lonely when i 'm alone
what does n't kill you makes you stronger , stronger
just me , myself and i
what does n't kill you makes you stronger
stand a little taller
does n't mean i 'm lonely when i 'm alone

you 've got your mother and your brother
every other undercover
tellin ' you what to say -say-
you think i 'm stupid
but the truth is
loving you has made me this way
so before you point your finger
get your hands off of my trigger
you need to know this situation 's getting old
and now the more you talk
the less i can take , oh
i 'm looking for attention
not another question
should you stay or should you go ?
well if you do n't have the answer
why are you still standing here ?
hey hey hey hey
just walk away
just walk away

i waited here for you
like a kid waiting after school
so tell me how come you never showed -showed- ?
i gave you everything
and never asked for anything
and look at me
i 'm all alone -alone-
so before you start defending
baby stop all your pretending
i know you know i know
so what 's the point in being slow
let 's get this show on the road today , hey

why are you still standing here ?
hey hey hey hey
just walk away
just walk away

live and breathe for me ?
cause if you do n't then just leave

well , you almost had me fooled
told me that i was nothing without you , oh
and after everything you 've done
i can thank you for how strong i have become
'cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell
i had to learn how to fight for myself
and we both know all the truth i could tell
i 'll just say this is i wish you farewell
i hope you 're somewhere praying , praying
i hope your soul is changing , changing
i hope you find your peace , falling on your knees
praying
i 'm proud of who i am
no more monsters , i can breathe again
and you said that i was done
well , you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'cause i can make it on my own
and i do n't need you , i found a strength i 've never known
i ’ ll bring thunder , i 'll bring rain , ah-oh
when i 'm finished , they wo n't even know your name
you brought the flames and you put me through hell
i had to learn how to fight for myself
and we both know all the truth i could tell
i 'll just say this is i wish you farewell
i hope you 're somewhere praying , praying
i hope your soul is changing , changing
i hope you find your peace , falling on your knees

song over
it was 1989 , my thoughts were short my hair was long
caught somewhere between a boy and man
she was 17 and she was far from in between
it was summertime in northern michigan
splashin ' thru the sandbar , talkin ' by the campfire
it 's the simple things in life like when and where
we did n't have no internet , but man i never will forget
the way the moonlight shined upon her hair
and we were tryin ' different things and we were smokin ' funny things
makin ' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
sippin ' whisky out the bottle not thinkin ' 'bout tomorrow
singin ' sweet home alabama all summer long
singin ' sweet home alabama all summer long
catchin ' walleye from the dock watchin ' waves roll off the rocks
she 'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
we 'd blister in the sun we could n't wait for night to come
to hit that sandy place of rock ' n roll
and we were tryin ' different things and we were smokin ' funny things
makin ' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
sippin ' whisky out the bottle not thinkin ' 'bout tomorrow
singin ' sweet home alabama all summer long
singin ' sweet home alabama all summer long
now nothin ' seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
oh how we thought those days would never end
sometimes i hear that song and i 'll start to sing along
and think man i 'd like to see that girl again
and we were tryin ' different things and we were smokin ' funny things
makin ' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
sippin ' whisky out the bottle not thinkin ' 'bout tomorrow
singin ' sweet home alabama all summer long
singin ' sweet home alabama all summer long

taking me higher than i 've ever been before
i 'm holding it back , just want to shout out , give me more
you 're just a hideaway , you 're just a feeling
you let my heart escape , beyond the meaning
not even i ca n't find a way to stop the storm
oh baby , it 's out of my control , it 's going home
but you 're just a chance i take to keep on dreaming
you 're just another day that keeps me breathing
baby , i love the way that there 's nothing sure
baby , do n't stop me , hideaway with me some more
ooh , aah , aah , ooh , ooh , aah , aah , ooh , ooh , aah , aah , ooh , ooh , aah , aah , ooh
you send me the shiver and the spine that might overflow
you 're bringing me closer to the edge , i 'm letting go
you 're just a hideaway , you 're just a feeling
you let my heart escape , beyond the meaning
putting my head into the clouds i 'm floating home
when you can be going i ca n't find a way to stop
you 're just a chance i take to keep on dreaming
you 're just another day that keeps me breathing
baby , i love the way that there 's nothing sure
baby , do n't stop me , hideaway with me some more
you 're just a hideaway , you 're just a feeling
you let my heart escape , beyond the meaning
not even i can find a way to stop the storm
oh baby , it 's out of my control what 's going on
you 're just a chance i take to keep on dreaming
you 're just another day , that keeps me breathing
you 're a day that keeps me dreaming

sometimes we fall down and ca n't get back up
we 're hiding behind skin that 's too tough
how come we don ’ t say i love you enough
till it 's too late , it 's not too late
our hearts are hungry for a food that wo n't come
we could make a feast from these crumbs
and we 're all staring down the barrel of a gun
so if your life flashes before you
what would you wish you would 've cone
lookin at the hand of the time we 've been given here
this is all we got and we got ta start pickin it
every second counts on a clock that 's tickin '
cotta live like we 're dying
86 400 seconds in a cay to
turn it all around or throw it all away
we cotta tell 'em that we love 'em
while we cot the chance to say
cotta live like we 're dying
and if your plane fell out of the skies
who would you call with your last goodbyes
should be so careful who we live out our lives
so when we long for absolution
there 'll no one on the line
lookin at the hand of the time we 've been given here
this is all we got and we got ta start pickin it
every second counts on a clock that 's tickin '
cotta live like we 're dying
like we 're dying oh -- like we 're dying
like we 're dying oh -- like we 're dying
we never know a good thing till it 's gone
you never see a crash until it 's head on
all those people right when we 're dead wrong
you never know a good thing till it 's gone
lookin at the hand of the time we 've been given here
this is all we cot and we got ta start pickin it
every second counts on a clock that 's tickin '

lyin ' here with you so close to me
it 's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
caught up in this moment
caught up in your smile
i 've never opened up to anyone
so hard to hold back when i 'm holding you in my arms
we do n't need to rush this
let 's just take this slow
just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
just a touch in the fire burning so bright
and i do n't want to mess this thing up
i do n't want to push too far
just a shot in the dark that you just might
be the one i 've been waiting for my whole life
so baby i 'm alright , with just a kiss goodnight
i know that if we give this a little time
it will only bring us closer to the love we wan na find
it 's never felt so real , no it 's never felt so right
no i do n't want to say goodnight
i know it 's time to leave , but you 'll be in my dreams
tonight

just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
just a touch in the fire burning so bright
and i do n't want to mess this thing up
i do n't want to push too far

picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
reaching for the phone 'cause i ca n't fight it anymore
and i wonder if i ever cross your mind
for me it happens all the time
it 's a quarter after one , i 'm all alone and i need you now
said i would n't come , but i lost all control and i need you now
and i do n't know how i can do without , i just need you now
another shot of whiskey , ca n't stop looking at the door
wishing you 'd come sweeping in the way you did before
and i wonder if i ever cross your mind
for me it happens all the time
it 's a quarter after one , i 'm a little drunk and i need you now
said i would n't come , but i lost all control and i need you now
and i do n't know how i can do without , i just need you now
yes i 'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all
it 's a quarter after one , i 'm all alone and i need you now

you 're giving me a million reasons to let you go
you 're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
you 're givin ' me a million reasons give me a million reasons
givin ' me a million reasons
about a million reasons
if i had a highway , i would run for the hills
if you could find a dry way , i 'd forever be still
but you 're giving me a million reasons
givin ' me a million reasons
about a million reasons
i bow down to pray
i try to make the worst seem better
lord , show me the way
to cut through all his worn out leather
i 've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
but baby , i just need one good one to stay
head stuck in a cycle , i look off and i stare
it 's like that i 've stopped breathing , but completely aware
'cause you 're giving me a million reasons
givin ' me a million reasons
about a million reasons
and if you say something that you might even mean
it 's hard to even fathom which parts i should believe
'cause you 're giving me a million reasons
givin ' me a million reasons
about a million reasons
i bow down to pray
i try to make the worst seem better
lord , show me the way
to cut through all his worn out leather
i 've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
but baby , i just need one good one to stay
hey , ehh , ehh , eyy
baby i 'm bleedin ' , bleedin '
ehh , ehh , ehhy
ca n't you give me what i 'm needin ' , needin '
every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
but baby , i just need one good one
good one , good one , good one , good one , good one
when i bow down to pray
i try to make the worst seem better
lord , show me the way
to cut through all his worn out leather
i 've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
but baby , i just need one good one , good one
tell me that you 'll be the good one , good one
baby , i just need one good one to stay

i hope you never lose your sense of wonder
you get your fill to eat , but always have that hunger
may you never take onw single breath for granted
god forbid love ever leave you empty-handed
i hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
whenever one door closes i hope one more opens
promise me that you 'll give fate the fighting chance
and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
i hope you dance
i hope you dance
i hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
never settle for the path of least resistance
living might mean taking chances , but they 're worth taking
loving might be a mistake , but it 's worth making
do n't let some hell-bent heart leave you bitter
when you come close to selling out reconsider
give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
i hope you dance i hope you dance
i hope you dance i hope you dance
i hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
whenever one door closes i hope one more opens
promise me that you 'll give fate the fighting chance
and when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
dance i hope you dance
i hope you dance i hope you dance
i hope you dance i hope you dance

it 's been the longest winter without you
i did n't know where to turn to
see somehow i cant forget you
after all that we 've been through
go in , come in thought i heard a knock
who 's there ? no one
thinking that i deserved it
now i realize that i really did n't know
you did n't notice , you mean everything
quickly im learning , to love again
all i know is , i will be ok
thought i could n't live without you
it 's gon na hurt when it heals too
it 'll all get better in time
even though i really love you
i 'm gon na smile cause i deserve to
it 'll all get better in time
how could i turn on the tv
without something there to remind me
was it all that easy
to just put aside your feelings
if i 'm dreaming
do n't wan na let , hurt my feelings
but thats the path , i believe in
and i know that , time will heal it
you did n't notice , you mean everything
quickly im learning , to love again
all i know is , i will be ok
thought i could n't live without you
it 's gon na hurt when it heals too
it 'll all get better in time
even though i really love you
i 'm gon na smile cause i deserve to
it 'll all get better in time
since theres no more you and me
it 's time i let you go so i can be free
and live my life how it should be
no matter how hard it is i 'll be fine without you
thought i could n't live without you
it 's gon na hurt when it heals too
it 'll all get better in time
even though i really love you
i 'm gon na smile cause i deserve to
it 'll all get better in time
thought i could n't live without you
it 's gon na hurt when it heals too
it 'll all get better in time
even though i really love you
i 'm gon na smile cause i deserve to
it 'll all get better in time

closed off from love i didn ’ t need the pain
once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
time starts to pass before you know it you ’ re frozen
but something happened for the very first time with you
my heart melted to the ground found something true
and everyone ’ s looking round thinking i ’ m going crazy
but i don ’ t care what they say i ’ m in love with you
they try to pull me away but they don ’ t know the truth
my heart ’ s crippled by the vein that i keep on closing
you cut me open and i
keep bleeding keep , keep bleeding love
i keep bleeding i keep , keep bleeding love
keep bleeding keep , keep bleeding love
you cut me open
song over
you were always hard to hold
so letting go aint easy
im hanging on but growing cold
while my mind is leaving

give me a word you can keep
cause im halfway gone and im on way
and im feelin feelin feelin this way
cause youre halfway in but dont take too long
cause im halfway gone im halfway gone
you got one foot out the door
and choking on the other
always think theres something more
its just around the corner

give me a word you can keep
cause im halfway gone and im on way
and im feelin feelin feelin this way

i 'm running and not quite sure where to go
i do n't know what i 'm diving into

nothing left to find
there 's nothing in the world

you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
never really had luck , couldn ’ t never figure out
how to love
how to love
you had a lot of moments that didn ’ t last forever
now you in the corner tryna put it together
how to love
how to love
for a second you were here
its hard not to stare , the way you moving your body
like you never had a love
never had a love
when you was just a young ’ un your looks but so precious
but now your grown up
so fly its like a blessing but you can ’ t have a man look at you for 5 seconds
without you being insecure
you never credit yourself so when you got older
it ’ s seems like you came back 10 times over
now you ’ re sitting here in this damn corner
looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
never really had luck , couldn ’ t never figure out
how to love
how to love
see you had a lot of moments that didn ’ t last forever
now you in the corner tryna put it together
how to love
how to love
for a second you were here
its hard not to stare the way you moving your body
like you never had a love
had a love
you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
the fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
but it wasn ’ t your fault
to be the one here talking to me
but i admire your poppin bottles and dippin ’
just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
baby , so don ’ t be mad
you see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
never really had luck , couldn ’ t never figure out
how to love
how to love
see you had a lot of moments that didn ’ t last forever
now you in the corner tryna put it together
how to love
how to love
oooh ,
see i just want you to know
you ’ re beautiful
and i want you to know , you ’ re far from the usual

memories consume
i do n't want to be the one
the battles always choose
'cause inside i realize

and say what i do n't mean .
i do n't know how i got this way
i know it 's not alright .
so i 'm breaking the habit ,
i 'm breaking the habit

clutching my cure
i try to catch my breath again
i hurt much more
i had no options left again
i do n't want to be the one
the battles always choose

i do n't know how i got this way

i 'm breaking the habit
tonight
i 'll paint it on the walls
'cause i 'm the one that falls
i 'll never fight again
and this is how it ends
i do n't know what 's worth fighting for
or why i have to scream .
but now i have some clarity
to show you what i mean .
i do n't know how i got this way
i know it 's not alright .

this is not the end , this is not the beginning ,
just a voice like a riot , rocking every revision
but you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
though the words sound steady something empty 's within 'em
waiting for the end to come
wishing i had strength to stand
this is not what i had planned
it 's out of my controoooool ... .
- oh ! - i know what it takes to move on ,
i know how it feels to lie ,
all i wan na do
is trade this life for something new
holding on to what i have n't gooooot
sitting in an empty room
trying to forget the past
this was never meant to last ,
i wish it was n't so ...
this is not the end this is not the beginning ,
just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
- holding on to what i have n't got - but you listen to the tone and the violet rhythm though the words sound steady something empty 's within 'em
- holding on to what i have n't got ! -
song over
in this farewell
there 's no blood
there 's no alibi
'cause i 've drawn regret
from the truth
of a thousand lies
so let mercy come and wash away
what i 've done
i 'll face myself
to cross out what i 've become
erase myself and let go of
what i 've done
put to rest
what you thought of me
while i clean this slate
with the hands
of uncertainty
so let mercy come and wash away
what i 've done
i 'll face myself
to cross out what i 've become
erase myself and let go of
what i 've done
for what i 've done
i 'll start again
and whatever thing may come
today this ends i 'm forgiving
what i 've done
i 'll face myself
to cross out what i 've become
erase myself and let go of
what i 've done
what i 've done
forgiving what i 've done

everytime our eyes meet , this feeling inside me
is almost more than i can take
baby when you touch me , i can feel how much you love me
and it just blows me away
i 've never been this close to anyone or anything
i can hear your thoughts , i can see your dreams ...
i do n't know how you do what you do
i 'm so in love with you , it just keeps getting better
i wan na spend the rest of my life with you by my side
forever and ever
every little thing that you do
baby i 'm amazed by you .
the smell of your skin , the taste of your kiss
the way you whisper in the dark
your hair all around me , baby you surround me
you touch every place in my heart
oh , it feels like the first time everytime
i wan na spend the whole night in your eyes ...
i do n't know how you do what you do
i 'm so in love with you , it just keeps getting better
i wan na spend the rest of my life with you by my side

i 've never seen a diamond in the flesh i cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies and i 'm not proud of my address , in the torn up town no post code envy
but every song 's like gold teeth , grey goose , trippin ' in the bathroom blood stains , ball gowns , trashin ' the hotel room ,
we do n't care , we 're driving cadillacs in our dreams .
but everybody 's like cristal , maybach , diamonds on your time piece . jet planes , islands , tigers on a gold leash .
we do n't care , we are n't caught up in your love affair .
and we 'll never be royals.. it do n't run in our blood ,
that kind of lux just ai n't for us .
we crave a different kind of buzz .
let me be your ruler , you can call me queen bee
and baby i 'll rule i 'll rule i 'll rule i 'll rule .
let me live that fantasy .
my friends and i we 've cracked the code . we count our dollars on the train to the party . and everyone who knows us knows that we 're fine with this , we did n't come from money .

making smart with their words again , well i 'm bored
because i 'm doing this for the thrill of it , killin ' it
never not chasing a million things i want
and i am only as young as the minute is full of it
getting pumped up from the little bright things i bought
baby be the class clown
i 'll be the beauty queen in tears
it 's a new art form showing people how little we care -yeah-
we 're so happy , even when we 're smilin ' out of fear
let 's go down to the tennis court , and talk it up like yeah -yeah-

once i was seven years old ,
my momma told me ,
go make yourself some friends or you 'll be lonely
once i was seven years old
it was a big big world ,
but we thought we were bigger .
pushing each other to the limits ,
by eleven smoking herb
and drinking burning liquor
never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
once i was eleven years old ,
my daddy told me ,
go get yourself a wife or you 'll be lonely .
once i was eleven years old
i always have that dream
like my daddy before me
so i´m started writing songs
something about the glory ,
just always seemed to bore me ,
cause only those i really love
once i was twenty years old ,
my story got told ,
before the morning sun , when life was lonely .
once i was twenty years old
i only seek my goals ,
i do n't believe in failure .
cause i know the smallest voices ,
i got my boys with me at least those in favour
and if we don´t see before i leave ,
once i was 20 years old
my story got told
i was writing about everything ,
once i was 20 years old
soon we´ll be 30 years old
our songs have been sold
we´re travel around the world
soon we´ll be 30 years old
i´m still learning about life
so i can sing them all my songs
and i can tell them storys
most of my boys are with me
some are still out seeking glory
my brother i´m still sorry
soon i´ll be 60 years old
my daddy got sixty-one
remember life and then your life
i make the man so happy
i hope my children come and visit
soon i´ll be 60 years old
when i have a lot of children
who can bore me
soon i´ll be 60 years old
soon i´ll be 60 years old
when i have a lot of children
who can warm
soon i´ll be 60 years old
once i was seven years old ,
my momma told me ,
go make yourself some friends or you 'll be lonely
once i was seven years old
once i was seven years old

games changes and fears
when will they go from here ? when will they stop ?
i believe that fate has brought us here
and we should be together babe , but were not .
i play ot off but im dreaming of you
and ill keep my cool but im fiendin
i try to say goodbye and i choke
i try to walk away and i stumble
though i try to hide it , its clear
my world crumbles when you are not near
goodbye and i choke
try to walk away and i stumble
though i try to hide it , its clear
my world crumbles when you are not near
i may appear to be free
but im just a prisoner of your love
and i may seem alright and smile when you leave
but my smiles are just a front , just a front
i play it off but im dreaming of you
and ill keep my cool but im feindin
i try to say goodbye and i choke
i try to walk away and i stumble
though i try to hide it , its clear
my world crumbles when you are not near
goodbye and i choke
try to walk away and i stumble
though i try to hide it , its clear
my world crumbles when you are not near
here is my confession , may i be your posession
boy i need your touch , your love kisses and such
with all my might i try but this is cant deny , deny
i play it off but im dreaming of you
and ill keep my cool but im feindin
i try to say goodbye and i choke
try to walk away and i stumble

beauty queen of only eighteen
she had some trouble with herself
he was always there to help her
she always belonged to someone else
i drove for miles and miles
and wound up at your door
i ’ ve had you so many times but somehow
i want more
i don ’ t mind spending everyday
out on your corner in the pouring rain
look for the girl with the broken smile
ask her if she wants to stay awhile
and she will be loved
she will be loved
tap on my window knock on my door
i want to make you feel beautiful
i know i tend to get insecure
it doesn ’ t matter anymore
it ’ s not always rainbows and butterflies
it ’ s compromise that moves us along
my heart is full and my door ’ s always open
you can come anytime you want
i don ’ t mind spending everyday
out on your corner in the pouring rain
look for the girl with the broken smile
ask her if she wants to stay awhile
and she will be loved
she will be loved
i know where you hide
alone in your car
know all of the things that make you who you are
i know that goodbye means nothing at all
comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls ...
tap on my window knock on my door
i want to make you feel beautiful
i don ’ t mind spending everyday
out on your corner in the pouring rain
look for the girl with the broken smile
ask her if she wants to stay awhile
and she will be loved
she will be loved

sunday morning rain is falling
steal some covers share some skin
clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
you twist to fit the mold that i am in
but things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
and i would gladly hit the road get up and go if i knew
that someday it would lead me back to you
that someday it would lead me back to you
that may be all i need
in darkness she is all i see
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning
and i never want to leave
fingers trace your every outline
paint a picture with my hands
back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
change the weather still together when it ends
that may be all i need
in darkness she is all i see
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning
and i never want to leave
but things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
and i would gladly hit the road get up and go if i knew
that someday it would lead me back to you
that someday it would lead me back to you
that may be all i need
in darkness she is all i see
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning
and i never want to leave

the fire burning in her eyes , the chaos that controlled my mind ... .
whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
never to return again but always in my heart
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice , i wo n't say goodbye anymore
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice , i wo n't say goodbye anymore
i 'll fix these broken things
repair your broken wings
and make sure everything 's alright
my pressure on your hips
sinking my fingertips
into every inch of you cause i know that 's what you want me to do
song over

song over
i asked her to stay -- but she would n't listen
she left before i had the chance to say oh
the words that were mend -- the things that were broken
but now its far too late she 's gone away
every night you cry yourself to sleep
thinking why does this happen to me
why does every moment have to be so hard
hard to believe it
it 's not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wo n't go home without you
the taste of her breath , i 'll never get over
and the noises that she make keep me awake oh
the weight of things that remain unspoken
built up so much it crushed us everyday
every night you cry yourself to sleep
thinking why does this happen to me
why does every moment have to be so hard
hard to believe it
it 's not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wo n't go home without you
it 's not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wo n't go home without you
of all the things i felt i 've never really showed
perhaps the worst is that i ever let you go , should not ever let you go oh oh oh
it 's not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wo n't go home without you
it 's not over tonight
just give me one more chance to make it right
i may not make it through the night
i wo n't go home without you
i wo n't go home without you
i wo n't go home without you
song over
i 'm waking up at the start of the end of the world ,
but its feeling just like every other morning before ,
now i wonder what my life is going to mean if it 's gone ,
the cars are moving like a half a mile an hour and i
started staring at the passengers who 're waving goodbye
can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time ?
but i believe the world is burning to the ground
oh well i guess we 're gon na find out
let 's see how far we 've come
let 's see how far we 've come
well i , believe , it all , is coming to an end
oh well , i guess , we 're gon na pretend ,
let 's see how far we 've come
let 's see how far we 've come
i think it turned ten o'clock but i do n't really know
then i ca n't remember caring for an hour or so
started crying and i could n't stop myself
i sat down on the street and took a look at myself
said where you going man you know the world is headed for hell
say goodbye to
but i believe the world is burning to the ground
oh well i guess we 're gon na find out
let 's see how far we 've come
let 's see how far we 've come
well i , believe , it all , is coming to an end
oh well , i guess , we 're gon na pretend ,
let 's see how far we 've come
let 's see how far we 've come
gone , gone baby , it 's all gone there 's no one in the corner and there 's nobody home well it was cool , cool it was just all cool now it 's over for me and it 's over for you
but i believe the world is burning to the ground
oh well i guess we 're gon na find out
let 's see how far we 've come
let 's see how far we 've come
well i , believe , it all , is coming to an end
oh well , i guess , we 're gon na pretend ,

song over
all day staring at the ceiling
making friends with shadows on my wall
all night hearing voices telling me
that i should get some sleep
because tomorrow might be good for something
hold on
feeling like i 'm headed for a breakdown
and i do n't know why
but i 'm not crazy , i 'm just a little unwell
i know right now you ca n't tell
but stay awhile and maybe then you 'll see
i 'm not crazy , i 'm just a little impaired
i know right now you do n't care
but soon enough you 're gon na think of me
and how i used to be ... me
i 'm talking to myself in public
dodging glances on the train
and i know , i know they 've all been talking about me
i can hear them whisper
and it makes me think there must be something wrong with me
out of all the hours thinking
somehow i 've lost my mind
but i 'm not crazy , i 'm just a little unwell
i know right now you ca n't tell
but stay awhile and maybe then you 'll see
i 'm not crazy , i 'm just a little impaired
i know right now you do n't care
but soon enough you 're gon na think of me
and how i used to be
i 've been talking in my sleep
pretty soon they 'll come to get me
yeah , they 're taking me away
but i 'm not crazy , i 'm just a little unwell
i know right now you ca n't tell
but stay awhile and maybe then you 'll see
i 'm not crazy , i 'm just a little impaired
i know right now you do n't care
but soon enough you 're gon na think of me
and how i used to be
yeah , how i used to be
how i used to be
well , i 'm just a little unwell
how i used to be how i used to be i 'm just a little unwell
song over
i miss the sound of your voice
i miss the rush of your skin
i miss the still of the silence
as you breathe out and i breathe in
if i could walk on water
if i could tell you what 's next
make you believe
make you forget
come on get higher
loosen my lips
faith and desire
and the swing of your hips
just pull me down hard
and drown me in love
come on get higher
loosen my lips
faith and desire
and the swing of your hips
just pull me down hard
and drown me in love
i miss the sound of your voice
the loudest thing in my head
and i ache to remember
all the violent , sweet , perfect words that you said
if i could walk on water
if i could tell you what 's next
make you believe
make you forget
come on get higher
loosen my lips
faith and desire
and the swing of your hips
just pull me down hard
and drown me in love
come on get higher
loosen my lips
faith and desire
and the swing of your hips
just pull me down hard
and drown me in love
i feel the pull of your heart
i taste the sparks on your tongue
i see angels and devils and god when you come on
come on get higher
loosen my lips
faith and desire
and the swing of your hips
just pull me down hard
and drown me in love
come on get higher
loosen my lips

i drive a sports car just to prove
i 'm a real big baller cause i made a million dollars
and i spend it on girls and shoes
but you do n't wan na be high like me
never really knowing why like me
you do n't ever wan na step off that roller coaster and be all alone
you do n't wan na ride the bus like this
never knowing who to trust like this
you do n't wan na be stuck up on that stage singing
stuck up on that stage singing
all i know are sad songs sad songs
darling all i know are sad songs sad songs
i 'm just a singer who already blew his shot
i get along with old timers
cause my name 's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
and i ca n't keep a girl no
cause as soon as the sun comes up
i cut em all loose and work 's my excuse
but the truth is i ca n't open up
never really knowing why like me
you do n't ever wan na step off that roller coaster and be all alone
you do n't wan na ride the bus like this
never knowing who to trust like this
you do n't wan na be stuck up on that stage singing
stuck up on that stage singing

darling all i know are sad songs sad songs
i took a plane to my hometown
i brought my pride and my guitar
all my friends are all gone but there 's manicured lawns
and the people still think i 'm a star
i walked around downtown
i met some fans on lafayette
they said tell us how to make it cause we 're getting real impatient
so i looked em in the eye and said
you do n't wan na be high like me
never really knowing why like me

song over
i never came to the beach , or stood by the ocean
i never sat by the shore , under the sun with my feet in the sand
but you brought me here and i 'm happy that you did
'cause now i 'm as free as birds catching the wind
i always thought i would sink , so i never swam
i never went boatin ' , do n't get how they are floatin '
and sometimes i get so scared of what i ca n't understand
but here i am , next to you
the sky 's more blue in malibu
next to you in malibu
next to you
we watched the sun go down as we were walking
i 'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
you would explain the current , as i just smile
hoping that you 'll stay the same , and nothing will change
and it 'll be us , just for a while
do we even exist ?
that 's when i make the wish , to swim away with the fish
is it supposed to be this hot all summer long ?
i never would 've believed you if three years ago you told me
i 'd be here writing this song
but here i am , next to you
the sky 's more blue in malibu
next to you in malibu
next to you
ah
ah
ah
ah
next to you
the sky 's more blue in malibu
next to you
we are just like the waves that flow back and forth
sometimes i feel like i 'm drowning
and you 're there to save me
and i wan na thank you with all of my heart
it 's a brand new start
a dream come true in malibu
song over
i can almost see it that dream i ’ m dreaming
but there ’ s a voice inside my head saying
you ’ ll never reach it ,
every step i ’ m taking , every move i make feels
lost with no direction
my faith is shaking but
but i got to keep trying
got to keep my
head held high
there ’ s always going to be another mountain i ’ m always going to want to make it move
always going to be an uphill battle
sometimes you
going to have to lose
ain ’ t about how fast i get there ain ’ t about what ’ s waiting on the other
side it ’ s the climb
the struggles i ’ m facing . the chances i ’ m taking
sometimes they knock me down but
no i ’ m not breaking
the pain i ’ m knowing . but these are the moments that
i ’ m going to remember most yeah
just got to keep going
and i i got
to be strong
just keep pushing on
there ’ s always going to be another mountain . i ’ m always going to want to make it move
always going to be an uphill battle
sometimes you
going to have to lose
ain ’ t about how fast i get there . ain ’ t about what ’ s waiting on the other
side it ’ s the climb
there ’ s always going to be another mountain . i ’ m always going to want to make it move
always going to be an uphill battle
sometimes you
going to have to lose
ain ’ t about how fast i get there . ain ’ t about what ’ s waiting on the other
side it ’ s the climb
keep on moving . keep climbing . keep the faith baby
it ’ s all about . it ’ s all about
the climb . keep the faith

we clawed , we chained our hearts in vain
we jumped , never asking why
we kissed , i fell under your spell
a love no one could deny
don ’ t you ever say i just walked away
i will always want you
i can ’ t live a lie , running for my life
i will always want you
i came in like a wrecking ball
i never hit so hard in love
all i wanted was to break your walls
all you ever did was wreck me
yeah , you wreck me
i put you high up in the sky
and now , you ’ re not coming down
it slowly turned , you let me burn
and now , we ’ re ashes on the ground
don ’ t you ever say i just walked away
i will always want you
i can ’ t live a lie , running for my life
i will always want you
i came in like a wrecking ball
i never hit so hard in love
all i wanted was to break your walls
all you ever did was wreck me
i came in like a wrecking ball
yeah , i just closed my eyes and swung
left me crouching in a blaze and fall
all you ever did was wreck me
yeah , you wreck me
i never meant to start a war
i just wanted you to let me in
and instead of using force
i guess i should ’ ve let you in
i never meant to start a war
i just wanted you to let me in
i guess i should ’ ve let you in
don ’ t you ever say i just walked away
i will always want you

song over
i want you by my side
so that i never feel alone again
they 've always been so kind
but now they 've brought you away from here
i hope they did n't get your mind
your heart is too strong anyway
we need to fetch back the time
they have stolen from us
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you 've never danced like this before
but we do n't talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
should n't talk about it
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you 've never danced like this before
but we do n't talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
coldest winter for me
no sun is shining anymore
the only thing i feel is pain
caused by absence of you
suspence is controlling my mind
i can not find the way out of here
i want you by my side
so that i never feel alone again
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you 've never danced like this before
but we do n't talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
should n't talk about it
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you 've never danced like this before

say goodbye to white picket fences
say hello to palm trees and benzes

sometimes the underdogs rise
and the mighty fall

i , i ca n't get these memories out of my mind
and some kind of madness has started to evolve
i , i tried so hard to let you go
but some kind of madness is swallowing me whole , yeah
i have finally seen the light
and i have finally realised what you mean
and now i need to know is this real love
or is it just madness keeping us afloat ?
and when i look back at all the crazy fights we 've had
it 's like some kind of madness was taking control , yeah
and now i have finally seen the light
and i have finally realised what you need
and now i have finally seen the end
and i 'm not expecting you to care , no
and i have finally seen the light
and i have finally realized
i need to love
i need to love
come to me , just in a dream
come on and rescue me
yes i know i can be wrong
maybe i 'm too headstrong

song over
they 're gon na clean up your looks
with all the lies and the books
to make a citizen out of you
because they sleep with a gun
and keep an eye on you son
so they can watch all the things you do
because the drugs never work
they gon na give you a smirk
cause they got methods
of keeping you clean
they 're gon na rip out your heads
your aspirations to shreads
another caught in the murder machine
they say all teenagers scare the living xxxx out of me
they could care less as long as someone will bleed
so darken your clothes
or strike a violent pose
maybe they 'll leave you alone
but not me
the boys and girls in the clique
the awful names that they stick
you 're never gon na fit in much kid
but if you 're troubled and hurt
what you got under your shirt
we 'll make them pay for the things that they did
they say all teenagers scare the living xxxx out of me
they could care less as long as someone will bleed
so darken your clothes
or strike a violent pose
maybe they 'll leave you alone
but not me
they say all teenagers scare the living xxxx out of me
they could care less as long as someone will bleed
so darken your clothes
or strike a violent pose
maybe they 'll leave you alone

song over
when i was a young boy
my father took me into the city
to see a marching band
he said , `` son , when you grow up
would you be the savior of the broken
the beaten and the damned ? ?
he said , `` will you defeat them
your demons and all the non-believers
the plans that they have made ?
because one day , i 'll leave you
a phantom to lead you in the summer
to join the black parade
when i was a young boy
my father took me into the city
to see a marching band
he said , `` son , when you grow up
would you be the savior of the broken
the beaten and the damned ?
sometimes i get the feeling
she 's watching over me
and other times i feel like i should go
and through it all , the rise and fall
the bodies in the streets
and when you 're gone we want you all to know
we 'll carry on , we 'll carry on
and though you 're dead and gone , believe me
your memory will carry on , we 'll carry on
and in my heart , i ca n't contain it
the anthem wo n't explain it
a world that sends you reeling
from decimated dreams
your misery and hate will kill us all
so paint it black and take it back
let 's shout it loud and clear
defiant to the end , we hear the call
to carry on , we 'll carry on
and though you 're dead and gone , believe me
your memory will carry on , we 'll carry on
and though you 're broken and defeated
your weary widow marches
on and on we carry through the fears . - ahh ahh ahh -
disappointed faces of your peers . - ahh ahh ahh -
take a look at me
'cause i could not care at all
do or die , you 'll never make me
because the world , will never take my heart .
go and try , you 'll never break me
we want it all , we wan na play this part .
i wo n't explain or say i 'm sorry
i 'm unashamed , i 'm gon na show my scar
give a cheer , for all the broken .
listen here , because it 's who we are .
i 'm just a man , i 'm not a hero
just a boy who had to sing this song
just a man , i 'm not a hero
i do n't care !
we 'll carry on , we 'll carry on
and though you 're dead and gone , believe me
your memory will carry on , we 'll carry on
and though you 're broken and defeated
you 're weary widow marches on- do or die , -
you 'll never make me
because the world , will never take my heart .
we want it all , we wan na play this part - we 'll carry on -
do or die , you 'll never make me
because the world , will never take my heart
we want it all , we wan na play this part - we 'll carry on -

staring at the blank page before you
open up the dirty window
let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find
reaching for something in the distance
so close you can almost taste it
feel the rain on your skin
no one else can feel it for you
only you can let it in
no one else , no one else
can speak the words on your lips
drench yourself in words unspoken
live your life with arms wide open
today is where your book begins
the rest is still unwritten
staring at the blank page before you
open up the dirty window
let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find
reaching for something in the distance
so close you can almost taste it

waking up to kiss you and nobody ’ s there
the smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
it ’ s hard
yesterday i thought i saw your shadow running round
it ’ s funny how things never change in this old town
so far from the stars
and i want to tell you everything
the words i never got to say the first time around
and i remember everything
from when we were the children playing in this fairground
wish i was there with you now
if the whole world was watching i ’ d still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you
mmm-mm-mm
i saw that you moved on with someone new
in the pub that we met he ’ s got his arms around you
it ’ s so hard
so hard
and i want to tell you everything
the words i never got to say the first time around
and i remember everything
from when we were the children playing in this fairground
wish i was there with you now
if the whole world was watching i ’ d still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you
you still make me nervous when you walk in the room
them butterflies they come alive when i ’ m next to you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you
mmm-mm-mm
and i know that it ’ s wrong
that i can ’ t move on
but there ’ s something about you
if the whole world was watching i ’ d still dance with you
drive highways and byways to be there with you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you
you still make me nervous when you walk in the room
them butterflies they come alive when i ’ m next to you
over and over the only truth
everything comes back to you

waiting here for someone
only yesterday we were on the run
you smiled back at me and your face lit up the sun
now i 'm waiting here for someone
and , oh love until you feel this rough
why 's it only you i 'm thinking of
my shadow 's dancing
without you for the first time
my heart is hoping
you 'll walk right in tonight
tell me there are things that you regret
cause if i 'm being honest i ai n't over you yet
it 's all i 'm asking
is it too much to ask ?
is it too much to ask ?
someone 's moving outside
the lights come on and down the drive
i forget you 're not here when i close my eyes
do you still think of me sometimes ?
and , oh love , watch the sun coming up
don ’ t it feel xxxxed up we 're not in love
my shadow 's dancing
without you for the first time
my heart is hoping
you 'll walk right in tonight
tell me there are things that you regret

from underneath the trees , we watch the sky
confusing stars for satellites
i never dreamed that you 'd be mine
but here we are , we 're here tonight
singing amen i , i 'm alive
singing amen i , i 'm alive
if everyone cared and nobody cried ,
if everyone loved and nobody lied ,
if everyone shared and swallowed their pride ,
we 'd see the day , when nobody died
a-amen i , amen i , i 'm alive
amen i , amen i , amen i , i 'm alive
and in the air the fireflies
our only light in paradise
we 'll show the world they were wrong
and teach them all to sing along
singing amen i , i 'm alive - i 'm alive -
singing amen i , i 'm alive
if everyone cared and nobody cried ,
if everyone loved and nobody lied ,
if everyone shared and swallowed their pride ,
we 'd see the day , when nobody died
if everyone cared and nobody cried ,
if everyone loved and nobody lied ,
if everyone shared and swallowed their pride ,
we 'd see the day , when nobody died
and as we lie beneath the stars ,
we realize how small we are ,
if they could love like you and me ,
imagine what the world could be
if everyone cared and nobody cried ,
if everyone loved and nobody lied ,
if everyone shared and swallowed their pride ,
we 'd see the day , when nobody died
if everyone cared and nobody cried ,

song over
my best friend gave me the best advice
he said each day 's a gift and not a given right
leave no stone unturned , leave your fears behind
and try to take the path less traveled by
that first step you take is the longest stride
if today was your last day
and tomorrow was too late
could you say goodbye to yesterday ?
would you live each moment like your last ?
leave old pictures in the past
donate every dime you have ?
if today was your last day
against the grain should be a way of life
what 's worth the prize is always worth the fight
every second counts 'cause there 's no second try
so live like you 'll never live it twice
do n't take the free ride in your own life
if today was your last day
and tomorrow was too late
could you say goodbye to yesterday ?
would you live each moment like your last ?
leave old pictures in the past
donate every dime you have ?
would you call old friends you never see ?
reminisce of memories
would you forgive your enemies ?
would you find that one you 're dreamin ' of ?
swear up and down to god above
that you finally fall in love
if today was your last day
if today was your last day
would you make your mark by mending a broken heart ?
you know it 's never too late to shoot for the stars
regardless of who you are
so do whatever it takes
'cause you ca n't rewind a moment in this life
let nothin ' stand in your way
cause the hands of time are never on your side
if today was your last day
and tomorrow was too late
could you say goodbye to yesterday ?
would you live each moment like your last ?
leave old pictures in the past
donate every dime you have ?
would you call old friends you never see ?
reminisce of memories
would you forgive your enemies ?
would you find that one you 're dreamin ' of ?
swear up and down to god above
that you finally fall in love
if today was your last day

this is the story of a girl
who cried a river and drowned the whole world
and while she looks so sad in photographs
i absolutely love her
when she smiles
how many days in a year
she woke up with hope but she only found tears
and i can be so insincere
making the promises never for real
as long as she stands there waiting
wearin ' the holes in the soles of her shoes
how many days disappear
you look in the mirror , so how do you choose
your clothes never wear as well the next day
and your hair never falls in quite the same way
you never seem to run out of things to say
this is the story of a girl
who cried a river and drowned the whole world
and while she looks so sad in photographs
i absolutely love her
when she smiles
how many lovers would stay
just to put up with this xxxx day after day
how did we wind up this way
watching our mouths for the words that we say
as long as we stand here waiting
wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose
how do we get there today
when we 're walking too far for the price of our shoes
your clothes never wear as well the next day
and your hair never falls in quite the same way
but you never seem to run out of things to say
this is the story of a girl
who cried a river and drowned the whole world
and while she looks so sad and lonely there
i absolutely love her
when she smiles
your clothes never wear as well the next day
and your hair never falls in quite the same way
but you never seem to run out of things to say
this is the story of a girl
who cried a river and drowned the whole world
and while she looks so sad in photgraphs
i absolutely love her
this is the story of a girl
her pretty face she hid from the world
and while she looks so sad and lonely there
i absolutely love her
this is the story of a girl
who cried a river and drowned the whole world
and while she looks so sad in photographs
i absolutely love her
when she smiles
when she smiles ...

i waited 'til i saw the sun
i do n't know why i did n't come
i left you by the house of fun
i do n't know why i did n't come
i do n't know why i did n't come
when i saw the break of day
i wished that i could fly away
instead of kneeling in the sand
catching teardrops in my hand
my heart is drenched in wine
but you 'll be on my mind
for-e-ver
out across the endless sea
i would die in ecstasy
but i 'll be a bag of bones
driving down the road along
my heart is drenched in wine
but you 'll be on my mind
for-e-ver
something has to make you run
i do n't know why i did n't come
i feel as empty as a drum
i do n't know why i did n't come
i do n't know why i did n't come
i do n't know why i did n't come

hey !
hey !
hey !
i do n't like walking around this old and empty house
so hold my hand , i 'll walk with you my dear
the stairs creak as i sleep , it 's keeping me awake
it 's the house telling you to close your eyes
some days i ca n't even trust myself
it 's killing me to see you this way
'cause though the truth may vary
this ship will carry
our bodies safe to shore
hey !
hey !
hey !
there 's an old voice in my head that 's holding me back
tell her that i miss our little talks
soon it will be over and buried with our past
we used to play outside when we were young - and full of life and full of love -
some days i do n't know if i am wrong or right
your mind is playing tricks on you my dear
'cause though the truth may vary
this ship will carry
our bodies safe to shore hey !
do n't listen to a word i say . hey !
the screams all sound the same . hey !
'cause though the truth may vary
this ship will carry
our bodies safe to shore
you 're gone , gone , gone away . i watched you disappear
all that 's left is a ghost of you
now we 're torn , torn , torn apart , there 's nothing we can do .
just let me go , we 'll meet again soon .
now wait , wait , wait for me . please hang around
i see you when i fall asleep . hey !
do n't listen to a word i say . hey !
the screams all sound the same . hey !
'cause though the truth may vary
this ship will carry
our bodies safe to shore
'cause though the truth may vary
this ship will carry
our bodies safe to shore

queen cause she ' stay strong , yeah yeah

do i make you feel like cheating and i 'm like no , not really cause
oh i think that i found myself a cheerleader
she is always right there when i need her

she walks like a model , she grants my wishes like a
genie in a bottle , yeah yeah

song over
your hand fits in mine like it 's made just for me
but bear this in mind , it was meant to be
and i 'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
and it all makes sense to me
i know you 've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
when you smile , you 've never loved your stomach or your thighs
the dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
but i 'll love them endlessly
i wo n't let these little things slip out of my mouth
but if i do , it 's you - oh it 's you , they add up to
i 'm in love with you , and all these little things
you ca n't go to bed , without a cup of tea
and maybe that 's the reason that you talk in your sleep
and all those conversations are the secrets that i keep
though it makes no sense to me
i know you 've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
you still have to squeeze into your jeans
but you 're perfect to me
i wo n't let these little things slip out of my mouth
but if it 's true , it 's you - oh it 's you , they add up to
i 'm in love with you , and all these little things
you 'll never love yourself half as much as i love you
and you 'll never treat yourself right darlin ' , but i want you to
if i let you know i 'm here for you
maybe you 'll love yourself like i love you , oh
and i 've just let these little things , slip out of my mouth
'cause it 's you - oh it 's you , it 's you they add up to
and i 'm in love with you , and all these little things
i wo n't let these little things slip out of my mouth
but if it 's true , it 's you - it 's you they add up to
i 'm in love with you
and all your little things

swing my heart across the line
and my face is flashing signs
seek it out and you shall find

young , but i 'm not that bold
i do n't think the world is sold

i 've been everywhere and back trying to replace
everything that i 've had till my feet went numb
praying like a fool that 's been on a run
heart 's still beating but it 's not working
it 's like a million dollar phone that you just ca n't ring
i reach out trying to love but i feel nothing
yeah , my heart is numb
but with you
i feel again
woo-hoo
woo-hoo
woo-hoo
woo-hoo
i 'm feeling better ever since you know me
i was a lonely soul but that 's the old me
it 's been a long time coming since i 've seen your face
i 've been everywhere and back trying to replace
everything that i broke till my feet went numb
praying like a fool that just shot a gun
heart still beating but it 's not working
it 's like a hundred thousand voices that just ca n't sing
i reach out trying to love but i feel nothing
oh my heart is numb
but with you
i feel again
yeah with you
i can feel again

hope when you take that jump
you do n't fear the fall
hope when the water rises
you build a wall
hope when the crowd screams out
they 're screaming your name
hope if everybody runs
you choose to stay
hope that you fall in love
and it hurts so bad
the only way you can know
is give it all you have
and i hope that you do n't suffer ,
but take the pain
hope when the moment comes
i , i , i , i did it all ,
i , i , i , i did it all ,
i owned every second that this world could give
i saw so many places , the things that i did
yeah , with every broken bone
i swear i lived
hope that you spend your days
but they all add up
and when that sun goes down
hope you raise your cup
i wish that i could witness
all your joy and all your pain
but until my moment comes
i , i , i , i did it all ,
i , i , i , i did it all ,
i owned every second that this world could give

washing what you know out to sea
you can see your life out of the window , tonight
if i lose myself tonight
it 'll be by your side
if i lose myself tonight

i 'm staring down myself , counting up the years
steady hands , just take the wheel
and every glance is killing me
time to make one last appeal for the life i lead
stop and stare
i think i 'm moving but i go nowhere
yeah , i know that everyone gets scared
but i 've become what i ca n't be , oh

and you 'd give anything to get what 's fair
but fair ai n't what you really need
oh , can you see what i see ?

song over
you would not believe your eyes
if ten million fireflies
lit up the world as i fell asleep
'cause they 'd fill the open air
and leave teardrops everywhere
you 'd think me rude but i would just stand and stare
i 'd like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
it 's hard to say that i 'd rather stay awake when i 'm asleep
'cause everything is never as it seems
'cause i 'd get a thousand hugs
from ten thousand lightning bugs
as they tried to teach me how to dance
a foxtrot above my head
a sock hop beneath my bed
a disco ball is just hanging by a thread
i 'd like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
it 's hard to say that i 'd rather stay awake when i 'm asleep
'cause everything is never as it seems when i fall asleep
leave my door open just a crack - please take me away from here -
'cause i feel like such an insomniac - please take me away from here -
why do i tire of counting sheep - please take me away from here -
when i 'm far too tired to fall asleep
to ten million fireflies
i 'm weird 'cause i hate goodbyes
i got misty eyes as they said farewell
but i 'll know where several are
if my dreams get real bizarre
'cause i saved a few and i keep them in a jar
i 'd like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
it 's hard to say that i 'd rather stay awake when i 'm asleep
'cause everything is never as it seems when i fall asleep
i 'd like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
it 's hard to say that i 'd rather stay awake when i 'm asleep
'cause everything is never as it seems when i fall asleep
i 'd like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
it 's hard to say that i 'd rather stay awake when i 'm asleep
because my dreams are bursting at the seams
song over
the stars lean down to kiss you ,
and i lie awake and miss you ,
pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere .
cause i 'll doze off safe and soundly ,
but i 'll miss your arms around me
i 'll send a postcard to you dear ,
cause i wish you were here .
i watch the night turn light blue ,
but it 's not the same without you ,
because it takes two to whisper quietly ,
the silence is n't so bad ,
till i look at my hands and feel sad ,
cause the spaces between my fingers
are right where yours fit perfectly .
i 'll find repose in new ways ,
though i have n't slept in two days ,
cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone .
but drenched in vanilla twilight ,
i 'll sit on the front porch all night ,
waist deep in thought because when i think of you .
i do n't feel so alone .
i do n't feel so alone .
i do n't feel so alone .
as many times as i blink i 'll think of you ... tonight .
i 'll think of you tonight .
when violet eyes get brighter ,
and heavy wings grow lighter ,
i 'll taste the sky and feel alive again .
and i 'll forget the world that i knew ,
but i swear i wo n't forget you ,
oh if my voice could reach back through the past ,
i 'd whisper in your ear ,
oh darling i wish you were here .
song over
i tear my heart open , i sew myself shut
my weakness is that i care too much
my scars remind me that the past is real
i tear my heart open just to feel
drunk and i 'm feeling down
and i just wan na be alone
i 'm pissed cause you came around
why do n't you just go home
cause you channel all your pain
and i ca n't help you fix yourself
you 're making me insane
i tear my heart open , i sew myself shut
my weakness is that i care too much
my scars remind me that the past is real
i tear my heart open just to feel
i tear my heart open , i sew myself shut
my weakness is that i care too much
my scars remind me that the past is real
i tear my heart open just to feel
i 'm drunk and i 'm feeling down
and i just wan na be alone
you should n't ever came around
why do n't you just go home ?
cause you 're drowning in the water
and i tried to grab your hand
and i left my heart open
but you did n't understand
but you did n't understand
go fix yourself
i ca n't help you fix yourself
but at least i can say i tried
i 'm sorry but i got ta move on with my own life
i ca n't help you fix yourself
but at least i can say i tried
i 'm sorry but i got ta move on with my own life
i tear my heart open , i sew myself shut
my weakness is that i care too much
my scars remind me that the past is real
i tear my heart open just to feel
i tear my heart open , i sew myself shut
my weakness is that i care too much
my scars remind me that the past is real
i tear my heart open just to feel
song over
i do n't mind ,

how can i decide what ’ s right
when you ’ re clouding up my mind
fight all the time
how can i ever own what ’ s mine
when you ’ re always taking sides
my pride no not this time
not this time
how did we get here
when i used
to know you so well
but how did we get here
i think i know
the truth is hiding in your
eyes and its hanging
on your tongue
just boiling in my blood
but you think that i cant see
are if you ’ re a man at all
this one out on my own
i ’ m screaming i love you so
my thoughts you can ’ t decode
how did we get here
when i used
to know you so well
but how did we get here
i think i know
do you see what we ’ ve done
fools of ourselves
do you see what we ’ ve done
fools of ourselves
how did we get here
when i still
love you so yeah yeah
how did we get here
when i still
love you so
i think i know
i think i know
there is something
i see in you
it might kill me
i want it to be true
song over
i 'm in the business of misery , let 's take it from the top
she 's got a body like an hourglass that 's ticking like a clock
it 's a matter of time before we all run out ...
when i thought he was mine , she caught him by the mouth
i waited eight long months
she finally set him free
i told him i could n't lie , he was the only one for me
two weeks and we had caught on fire
she 's got it out for me , but i wear the biggest smile
whoa ... well i never meant to brag
but i got him where i want him now
whoa ... it was never my intention to brag
to steal it all away from you now
but god does it feel so good
and if you could then you know you would
it just feels so good
second chances : they do n't ever matter , people never change
once a whore , you 're nothing more , i 'm sorry that 'll never change
and about forgiveness , we 're both supposed to have exchanged
i 'm sorry honey , but i 'm passing up , now look this way
well there 's a million other girls who do it just like you
looking as innocent as possible to get to who
they want and what they like , it 's easy if you do it right
well i refuse , i refuse , i refuse !
whoa ... well i never meant to brag
but i got him where i want him now
whoa ... it was never my intention to brag
to steal it all away from you now
but god does it feel so good
and if you could then you know you would
it just feels so goooooooooooood
i watched his wildest dreams come true
not one of them involving you
just watch my wildest dreams come true
not one of them involving ...
whoa , what ever makes you brag
but i got him where i want him now ...
whoa ... it was never my intention to brag
to steal it all away from you now
but god does it feel so good
and if you could then you know you would
it just feels so good

can ’ t count the years one hand
i need the other one to hold you .
make you feel , make you feel better .
it ’ s not a walk in the park
but when our fingers interlock ,
can ’ t deny , can ’ t deny you ’ re worth it
cause after all this time .
i ’ m still into you
i should be over all the butterflies
but i ’ m into you -i ’ m in to you-
and baby even on our worst nights
i ’ m into you -i ’ m into you-
let em wonder how we got this far
cause i don ’ t really need to wonder at all
yeah after all this time
i ’ m still into you
recount the night that i first
and on the drive back to my house
i told you that , i told you that i loved ya .
you felt the weight of the world
and to your favorite song
we sang along to the start of forever
cause after all this time .
i ’ m still into you
i should be over all the butterflies
but i ’ m into you -i ’ m in to you-

song over
i do n't mind spending some time
just hanging here with you
cause i do n't find too many guys
that treat me like you do .
those are the guys i want to take me for a ride
but when i walk their talk is suicide
some people never get beyond their stupid pride
but you can see the real me inside
and i 'm satisfied , oh no , oh ...
even though the gods are crazy
even though the stars are blind
if you show me real love baby , i 'll show you mine
i can make it nice or naughty ,
be the devil and angel too ,
got a heart and soul in body , let 's see what this love can do .
maybe i 'm perfect for you .
i could be your confidant
just one of your girlfriends
but i know that love 's what you want
if tomorrow the world ends .
why should n't we be with the one we really love ?
now tell me who have you been dreaming of ?
i and i alone ? oh no , oh ...
even though the gods are crazy
even though the stars are blind
if you show me real love baby , i 'll show you mine
i can make it nice or naughty ,
be the devil and angel too ,
got a heart and soul in body , let 's see what this love can do .
maybe i 'm perfect for you .
excuse me for feeling
this moment is critical
it might be revealing
we could get physical , oh no , no no .
even though the gods are crazy
even though the stars are blind
if you show me real love baby , i 'll show you mine
i can make it nice or naughty ,
be the devil and angel too ,
got a heart and soul in body , let 's see what this love can do .
let 's see what love can do .
maybe i 'm perfect for you .
oooooh , oooooh , oooooh .
maybe i 'm perfect for you .
even though the gods are crazy
even though the stars are blind
even though the gods are crazy
even though the stars are blind ...
song over
well you only need the light when it s burning low
only miss the sun when it s starts to snow
only know your lover when you let her go
only know you ve been high when you re feeling low
only hate the road when you re missin home
only know your lover when you ve let her go
and you let her go
staring at the bottom of your glass
hoping one day you will make a dream last
the dreams come slow and goes so fast
you see her when you close your eyes
maybe one day you will understand why
everything you touch all it dies
because you only need the light when it s burning low
only miss the sun when it s starts to snow
only know your lover when you let her go
only know you ve been high when you re feeling low
only hate the road when you re missin home
only know your lover when you ve let her go
staring at the ceiling in the dark
same old empty feeling in your heart
love comes slow and it goes so fast
well you see her when you fall asleep
but to never to touch and never to keep
because you loved her to much
and you dive too deep
because you only need the light when it s burning low
only miss the sun when it s starts to snow
only know your lover when you let her go
only know you ’ ve been high when you re feeling low
only hate the road when you re missin home
only know your lover when you ve let her go

to make you well , to make you well

the sun may rise in the east
at least it settles in the final location

be my very own constellation
getting high on information
and buy me a star on the boulevard
it 's californication
space may be the final frontier
but it 's made in a hollywood basement
cobain can you hear the spheres
singing songs off station to station
and alderon 's not far away

we were always just that close
wrist to wrist
toe to toe
lips that just felt just like the inside of a rose
so how come when i reach out my fingers
it feels like more than distance between us
in this california king bed
we 're ten thousand miles apart
i bet california wishing on these stars of your heart
for me
my california king
eye to eye
cheek to cheek
side by side
you were sleeping next to me
arm to arm
dusk to dawn
with the curtains drawn
and a little last nite on these sheets
so how come when i reach out my fingers
it seems like more than distance between us
in this california king bed
we 're ten thousand miles apart
i bet california wishing on these stars of your heart
for me
my california king
just when i felt like giving up on us
you turned around and gave me one last touch
that made everything feel better
and even then my eyes got better
so confused wan na ask you if you love me
maybe i 've been california dreaming
in this california king bed
we 're ten thousand miles apart
i bet california wishing on these stars of your heart

my california king

no more gas in the rig

nothing heard , nothing said
ca n't even speak about it
all my life on my head
do n't want to think about it
feels like i 'm going insane
ye-ah
it 's a thief in the night
to come and grab you
it can creep up inside you
and consume you
a disease of the mind
it can control you
it 's too close for comfort
song over
you look so dumb right now ,
standin ' outside my house ,
tryin ' to apologize ,
you ’ re so ugly when you cry ,
please , just cut it out .
and don ’ t tell me you ’ re sorry 'cause you ’ re not ,
baby when i know you ’ re only sorry you got caught ,
but you put on quite a show
you really had me goin ' ,

and the award for the best liar goes to you - goes to you - ,
for makin ' me believe that you could be faithful to me ,
let 's hear your speech out ,
how about a round of applause ,

story of my life
searching for the right
but it keeps avoiding me
sorrow in my soul
really loves my company
he 's more than a man
and this is more than love
the reason that the sky is blue
but clouds are rollin ' in
and to him i just ca n't be true
and i know that he knows i 'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy
with some other guy
i do n't wan na do this anymore
i do n't wan na be the reason why
everytime i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i do n't wan na hurt him anymore
i do n't wan na take away his life
i do n't wan na be ...
i feel it in the air
as i 'm doin ' my hair
preparing for another date
a kiss upon my cheek
accepts i 'm gon na be out late
i say i wo n't belong
just hangin ' with the girls
a lie i did n't have to tell
because we both know
and we know it very well
'cause i know that he knows i 'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy
with some other guy
i do n't wan na do this anymore
i do n't wan na be the reason why
everytime i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i do n't wan na hurt him anymore
i do n't wan na take away his life
i do n't wan na be ...
our love
his trust
i might as well take a gun and put it to his head
get it over with
i do n't wan na do this
anymore , whoah.. , anymore
i do n't wan na do this anymore
i do n't wan na be the reason why
everytime i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i do n't wan na hurt him anymore
i do n't wan na take away his life
i do n't wan na be ...

i 've been ignoring this big lump in my throat . i should n't be crying .
tears were for the weaker days
i 'm stronger , now what , so i say , but something 's missing
whatever it is , it feels like
it 's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
whatever it is , it 's just laughing at me , and i just wan na scream :
what now ? i just ca n't figure it out
what now ? i guess i 'll just wait it out
what now ?
whoa , what now ?
i found the one , he changed my life
but was it me that changed
and he just happened to come at the right time
i 'm supposed to be in love , but i 'm numb again
whatever it is , it feels like
it 's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
whatever it is , it 's just sitting there ,
laughing at me , and i just wan na scream :
what now ? i just ca n't figure it out
what now ? i guess i 'll just wait it out
what now ? please tell me
what now ?
there 's no one to call cause i 'm just playing games with them all
the more i swear i 'm happy , the more that i 'm feeling alone
cause i spent every hour just going through the motions
i ca n't even get the emotions to come out
dry as a bone , but i just wan na shout
what now ? i just ca n't figure it out
what now ? i guess i 'll just wait it out -wait it out-
what now ? somebody tell me
what now ?
i do n't know where to go
i do n't know what to feel
i do n't know how to cry
i do n't know oh oh why
i do n't know where to go

tell me baby what we gon na do
i 'll make it easy , got a lot to lose
watch the sunlight coming through
open the window , let it shine on you
cos i 've been sick and working all week
and i 've been doing just fine
you 've been tired of watching me
forgot to have a good time boy
you ca n't take it , all these faces
never keeping it real
i know exactly how you feel
when you say you 've had enough
and you might just give it up
oh ooh , i will never let you down
when you 're feeling low on love
i 'll be what you 're dreaming of
oh ooh , i will never let you down
there 's a million ways to go
do n't be embarrassed if you lose control
on the rooftop , now they know
your body 's frozen and you 've lost your soul
cos i 've been sick and working all week
and i 've been doing just fine
you 've been tired of watching me
forgot to have a good time boy
you ca n't take it , all these faces
never keeping it real
i know exactly how you feel
when you say you 've had enough
and you might just give it up
oh ooh , i will never let you down
when you 're feeling low on love
i 'll be what you 're dreaming of
oh ooh , i will never let you down
let me take you where you never go
have a little fun , it 's the only way we know
let me show you what you never see
you know how to love , only when you 're holding me
when you say you 've had enough
and you might just give it up
oh ooh , i will never let you down
when you 're feeling low on love
i 'll be what you 're dreaming of
oh ooh , i will never let you down

all i need 's a little love in my life
all i need 's a little love in the dark
a little but i 'm hoping it might kick start
me and my broken heart
i need a little loving tonight
hold me so i 'm not falling apart
a little but i 'm hoping it might kick start
me and my broken heart
shot gun , aimed at my heart , you got one
tear me apart and then some
how do we call this love
i try to run away but your eyes
tell me to stay oh why-y
why do we call this love
it seems like we 've been losing control
somebody tell me i 'm not alone when i say
all i need 's a little love in my life
all i need 's a little love in the dark

song over
oh what the hell she says
i just ca n't win for losing
and she lays back down
man there 's so many times
i do n't know what i 'm doing
like i do n't know now
by the light of the moon
she rubs her eyes
can make you blind
i can just imagine
and i do n't know what i 'm supposed to do
but if she feels bad then i do too
so i let her be
and she says ooh
i ca n't take no more
her tears like diamonds on the floor
and her diamonds bring me down
cuz i ca n't help her now
she 's down in it
she tried her best and now she ca n't win it 's
hard to see them on the ground
her diamonds falling down
she sits down and stares into the distance
and it takes all night
and i know i could break her concentration
but it do n't feel right
by the light of the moon
she rubs her eyes
sits down on the bed and starts to cry
and there 's something less about her
and i do n't know what i 'm supposed to do
so i sit down and i cry too
and do n't let her see
and she says ooh
i ca n't take no more
her tears like diamonds on the floor
and her diamonds bring me down
cuz i ca n't help her now
she 's down in it
she tried her best and now she ca n't win it 's
hard to see them on the ground
her diamonds falling down
she shuts out the night
tries to close her eyes
if she can find daylight
she 'll be all right
she 'll be all right
just not tonight
and she says ooh
i ca n't take no more
her tears like diamonds on the floor
and her diamonds bring me down
cuz i ca n't help her now
she 's down in it
she tried her best and now she ca n't win it 's
hard to see them on the ground
her diamonds falling down

song over
there was a time
when i was alone
nowhere to go
and no place to call home
my only friend was the man in the moon
and even sometimes he would go away too
then one night i close my eyes
i saw a shadow flying high
he came to me
with the sweetest smile
told me he wanted to talk for awhile
he said `` peter pan that 's what they call me .
i promise that you 'll never be lonely . ''
and ever since that day
i am a lost boy from neverland
usually hanging out with peter pan
and when we 're bored we play in the woods
always on the run from captain hook
`` run , run , lost boy '' they say to me
away from all of reality
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
he sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
believe in him , and believe in me
together we will fly away in a cloud of green
to your beautiful destiny
as we soared above the town that never loved me
i realized i finally had a family
soon enough we reached neverland
peacefully my feet hit the sand
and ever since that day
i am a lost boy , from neverland
usually hangin ' out with peter pan
and when we 're bored we play in the woods
always on the run from captain hook
`` run , run , lost boy '' they say to me
away from all of reality
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
peter pan , tinkerbell , wendy darling ,
even captain hook , you are my perfect storybook
neverland i love you so , you are now my home sweet home
forever a lost boy at last
peter pan , tinkerbell , wendy darling ,
even captain hook , you are my perfect storybook
neverland i love you so , you are now my home sweet home
forever a lost boy at last
and for always i will sing
i am a lost boy from neverland
usually hangin ' out with peter pan
and when we 're bored we play in the woods
always on the run from captain hook
`` run , run , lost boy '' they say to me
away from all of reality
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
song over
lost in the cracks of the landslide
you saw me slipping on my blind side
i 'm feeling lost , feeling tongue-tied
and now i 'm frozen in your headlights
deep in the haze of your love high
i used to soar on the live wire
i 'm coming down from your supply
and i do n't know if you can make right
i ca n't take it , from the day i saw my heart start breaking no one saved me
i ca n't take it , ca n't believe i went and lost you baby , earth keeps shaking
all around , oh , you let me down
and i ca n't take it from the day i saw my heart start breaking , no one saved me
shot through the cracks of the earthquake
my body 's moving into retrograde
i 'm feeling loose , feeling untamed ...
and you 're the dynamite in my chains
deep in the trench of the crossfire
you shot me down from the live wire
tossed to the loss in your love game
you beat me cheating and now i ca n't play
i ca n't take it , from the day i saw my heart start breaking no one saved me
i ca n't take it , ca n't believe i went and lost you baby , earth keeps shaking
all around , oh , you let me down
and i ca n't take it from the day i saw my heart start breaking , no one saved me
hit the ground running up from you
baby you know i do n't want to
know i want you , but there 's nothing left to say
lost in the riddle you gave me
caught in the middle you played me
seems so crazy , but there 's nothing left to say ...
i should 've known , i should 've known
i ca n't take it , from the day i saw my heart start breaking no one saved me
i ca n't take it , ca n't believe i went and lost you baby , earth keeps shaking
all around , oh , you let me down
and i ca n't take it from the day i saw my heart start breaking , no one saved me

there 'll be girls across the nation
that will eat this up babe
i know that it 's your soul but could you bottle it up and
get down to the heart of it ,
no it 's my heart you 're xxxx out of your luck
do n't make me tell you again my love love love love .
love love love love .
only thing i ever could need , only one good thing
worth trying to be and it 's

started as a flicker meant to be a flame
skin has gotten thicker but it burns the same
still a baby in a cradle got to take my first fall
baby 's getting next to nowhere with her back
against the wall .
you meant to make me happy make me sad .
want to make it better better so bad .
but save your resolutions for your never new year
there is only one solution i can see here .
love you 're all i ever could need only one good thing
worth trying to be and it 's
love - love

i do it for love , love , love , love
oh , only gon na get get what you give away ,
only gon na get get what you give away

somebody once told me the world is gon na roll me
i ai n't the sharpest tool in the shed
she was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her
thumb in the shape of an `` l '' on her forehead
well the years start coming and they do n't stop coming
back to the rules and i hit the ground running
did n't make sense not to live for fun
your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
so much to do so much to see
so what 's wrong with taking the back streets
you 'll never know if you do n't go
you 'll never shine if you do n't glow
hey now you 're an all star get your game on , go play
hey now you 're a rock star get the show on get paid
and all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
it 's a cool place and they say it gets colder
you 're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older
but the media men beg to differ
judging by the hole in the satellite picture
the ice we skate is getting pretty thin
the waters getting warm so you might as well swim
my world 's on fire how about yours
that 's the way i like it and i never get bored
hey now you 're an all star get your game on , go play
hey now you 're a rock star get the show on get paid
and all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
somebody once asked , could you spare some change for gas
i need to get myself away from this place
i said yep what a concept i could use a little fuel myself
and we could all use a little change
well the years start coming and they do n't stop coming
back to the rules and i hit the ground running
did n't make sense not to live for fun
your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
so much to do so much to see
so what 's wrong with taking the back streets
you 'll never know if you do n't go
you 'll never shine if you do n't glow
hey now you 're an all star get your game on , go play
hey now you 're a rock star get the show on get paid
and all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold

we 'll do it all , everything , on our own .
we do n't need anything , or anyone .
if i lay here , if i just lay here
would you lie with me , and just forget the world .
i do n't quite know how to say how i feel
those three words , i said too much , but not enough .
if i lay here , if i just lay here
would you lie with me , and just forget the world .
forget what we 're told , before we get too old
show me a garden that 's bursting into life .
let 's waste time , chasing cars , around our heads .
i need your grace to remind me , to find my own .
if i lay here , if i just lay here
would you lie with me , and just forget the world .
forget what we 're told , before we get too old
show me a garden that 's bursting into life .
all that i am , all that i ever was
is here in your perfect eyes , they 're all i can see
i do n't know where , confused about how as well
just know that these things will never change for us at all .

song over
i 'm looking at you through the glass
do n't know how much time has passed
oh , god it feels like forever , but no one ever tells you that
forever feels like home , sitting all alone inside your head
how do you feel , that is the question
but i forget , you do n't expect an easy answer
when something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up
like paper dolls and little notes , you ca n't expect a bit of hope
so while you 're outside looking in , describing what you see
remember what you 're staring at is me
cause i 'm looking at you through the glass
do n't know how much time has passed
all i know is it feels like forever , but no one ever tells you that
forever feels like home , sitting all alone inside your head
cause i 'm looking at you through the glass
do n't know how much time has passed
all i know is it feels like forever , but no one ever tells you that
forever feels like home , sitting all alone inside your head
cause i 'm looking at you through the glass
do n't know how much time has passed
all i know is it feels like forever , but no one ever tells you that
forever feels like home , sitting all alone inside your head
and it 's the stars , the stars ; that shine for you
and it 's the stars , the stars ; that lie to you , yeah
cause i 'm looking at you through the glass
do n't know how much time has passed
all i know is it feels like forever , but no one ever tells you that
forever feels like home , sitting all alone inside your head
cause i 'm looking at you through the glass
do n't know how much time has passed
all i know is it feels like forever , but no one ever tells you that

'cause she 's so high ...
high above me , she 's so lovely

song over
i 'm so glad you made the time to see me
how 's life , tell me how 's your family
i have n't seen them in a while
you 've been good , busier than ever
we small talk , work and the weather
you 're guard is up , and i know why
because the last time you saw me
it 's still burned in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and i left them there to die
so this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying
`` i 'm sorry for that night '' and i go
back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ai n't
nothing but missing you
wishing i 'd realized what i had
when you were mine
i 'd go back to december ,
turn around and make it all right
i go back to december all the time
these days i have n't been sleeping
stayin ' up playing back myself leaving
when your birthday passed and i did n't call
then i think about summer all the beautiful times
i watch you laughing from the passenger side
and realized i loved you in the fall
and then the cold came the dark days
when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and
all i gave you was goodbye
so this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying
`` i 'm sorry for that night '' and i go
back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ai n't
nothing but missing you
wishing i 'd realized what i had
when you were mine
i 'd go back to december ,
turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
i miss your tan skin your sweet smile
so good to me , so right
and how you held me in your arms
that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinking
probably mindless dreaming
if you loved again i swear i 'd love you right
i 'd go back in time and change it but i ca n't
so if the chain is on your door i understand
but this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying
`` i 'm sorry for that night '' and i go
back to december ...
it turns out freedom ai n't
nothing but missing you
wishing i 'd realized what i had
when you were mine
i 'd go back to december
turn around and make it all right
i 'd go back to december
turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
all the time

grab your passport and my hand
i can make the bad guys good for a weekend
so it 's gon na be forever or it 's gon na go down in flames
if the high was worth the pain
they 'll tell you i 'm insane
cause you know i love the players and you love the game
we 'll take this way too far
or with a nasty scar
they 'll tell you i 'm insane
but i got a blank space baby and i '' ll write your name
cherry lips , crystal skies
i could show you incredible things
you 're the king baby i 'm your queen
wait the worst is yet to come , oh no
i can make all the tables turn
like `` oh my god who is she ? ''
but you 'll come back each time you leave
cause darlin ' i 'm a nightmare , dressed like a daydream
so it 's gon na be forever or it 's gon na go down in flames
if the high was worth the pain
they 'll tell you i 'm insane
cause you know i love the players and you love the game
we 'll take this way too far
or with a nasty scar
they 'll tell you i 'm insane -insane-

boys only want love if it 's torture
do n't say i , say i did n't warn you
boys only want love if it 's torture dm* do n't say i , say i did n't warn you

keep your ey-eyes open
the tricky thing
is yesterday we were just , children
playing soldiers just pre-tending
dreaming dreams with happy endings
in backyards ,
winning battles with the , wooden swords
but now we 've stepped into a , cruel world
where everybody stands and , keeps score

everybody 's waiting for you to breakdown
everybody 's watching to see the fallout
even when you 're sleepin ' , sleepin '
keep your ey-eyes open
keep your ey-eyes open
keep your ey-eyes open
so here you are
two steps ahead and staying , on guard
every lesson forms a , new scar
they never thought you 'd make it , this far
but turn around
oh , they surrounded you , it 's , a showdown
and nobody comes to save you now
but you got something they do n't
you just got ta keep your eyes open

song over
you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
its the morning of your very first day
you say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
try and stay out of everybodys way
it 's your freshman year and you 're gon na be here
for the next four years in this town
hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
you know i have n't seen you around , before
'cause when you 're fifteen and
somebody tells you they love you
you 're gon na believe them
and when you 're fifteen
feeling like there 's nothing to figure out
well count to ten , take it in
this is life before you know who you 're gon na be
at fifteen
you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough you 're best friends
laughing at the other girls who think they 're so cool
we 'll be out of here as soon as we can
and then you 're on your very first date
and he 's got a car and you 're feeling like flying
and you 're momma 's waiting up and you 're thinking he 's the one
and you 're dancing round your room when the night ends
when the night ends
'cause when you 're fifteen and
somebody tells you they love you
you 're gon na believe them
and when you 're fifteen
and your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
but in your life you 'll do things greater than
dating the boy on the football team
but i didnt know it at fifteen
when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then i swore i was gon na marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had to a boy
who changed his mind and we both cried
'cause when you 're fifteen and
somebody tells you they love you
you 're gon na believe them
and when you 're fifteen
do n't forget to look before you fall
i 've found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you 're supposed to be
i did n't know who i was supposed to be
at fifteen
la la la la la
la la la la la
your very first day , take a deep breath girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

i like your face despite your nose
17 and a half years old
i 'm worrying about my brother finding out
where 's the fun in doing what you 're told ?
i said `` no !
oh give it a rest , i could persuade you
i 'm not your typical , stoned 18 year old
give me a night i 'll make you .
i know you 're looking for salvation in the secular age ,
but girl i 'm not your saviour ''
wrestle to the ground
god help me now
a pair of frozen hands to hold ,
oh she 's so southern so she feels the cold ,
one moment i was tearing off your blouse ,
now you 're living in my house .
what happened to just messing around ?
i said `` yo , i think i better go ; i ca n't take you .
you just sit and get stoned with 30 year olds and you think you 've made it .
well , should n't you be xxxxing with somebody your age instead of making changes ? ''
wrestle to the ground
god help me now
i told her from the start
destined to be hard
i told her from the start
i 'll break your heart
destined to be hard
break your heart
i said `` yo , i think you 'd better go ; i ca n't take you .

if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song
oh oh , oh oh
lord make me a rainbow , i 'll shine down on my mother
she 'll know i 'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
oh and life ai n't always what you think it ought to be
no , ai n't even grey , but she buries her baby
the sharp knife of a short life
well , i 've had just enough time
if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song
the sharp knife of a short life
well , i 've had just enough time
and i 'll be wearing white when i come into your kingdom
i 'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
i 've never known the loving of a man
but it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
there 's a boy here in town says he 'll love me forever
who would have thought forever could be severed by
the sharp knife of a short life
well , i 've had just enough time
so put on your best boys
and i 'll wear my pearls
what i never did is done
oh no , i 'll sell them for a dollar
they 're worth so much more after i 'm a goner
and maybe then you 'll hear the words i 've been singing
funny when you 're dead how people start listening
if i die young
bury me in satin
lay me down on a bed of roses
sink me in the river at dawn
send me away with the words of a love song
oh oh , the ballad of a dove
go in peace and love
gather up your tears
keep them in your pocket
save them for a time when you 're really gon na need them .
oh oh , the sharp knife of a short life
well , i 've had just enough time
so put on your best boys
and i 'll wear my pearls
song over
so lately you 're wondering who will be there to take my place
when i 'm gone you 'll need love to light the shadows on your face
if a grate wave shall fall and fall upon us all
then between sand and stone could you make it on your own ?
if i could then i would i 'll go wherever you will go
way up high or down low i 'll go wherever you will go
maybe i 'll find out a way to make it back someday
to want you to guide you through the darkest of your days
if a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
then i hope there 's someone out there who can bring me back to you
if i could then i would i 'll go wherever you will go
way up high or down low i 'll go wherever you will go
run away with my heart
run away with my hope
run away with my love
i know now just quite how
my life and love might still go on
in your heart in your mind
i 'll stay with you for all of time
if i could then i would i 'll go wherever you will go
way up high or down low i 'll go wherever you will go
if i could turn back time i 'll go wherever you will go
if i could make you mine i 'll go wherever you will goooooooooooo
goooooooo i 'll go wherever you will gooooooooooo

she 's cold and she 's cruel but she knows what she 's doing
she pushed me in the pool at our high school reunion
she laughs at my dreams , but i dream about her laughter
strange as it seems , she 's the one i 'm after
cause she 's bittersweet
she knocks me off my feet
and i ca n't help myself
i do n't want anyone else
she 's a mystery
she 's too much for me
but i keep coming back for more
she 's just the girl i 'm looking for
she ca n't keep a secret for more than an hour
she runs on one hundred proof attitude power
and the more she ignores me the more i adore her
what can i do ? i 'd do anything for her
cause she 's bittersweet
she knocks me off my feet
and i ca n't help myself
i do n't want anyone else
she 's a mystery
she 's too much for me
but i keep coming back for more
she 's just the girl i 'm looking for
the way she sees it 's me
she wo n't pick up the phone
she 'd rather be alone
but i ca n't give up just yet
cause every word she 's ever said
is still ringing in my head
still ringing in my head
she 's cold and she 's cruel but she knows what she 's doing
knows just what to say so my whole day is ruined
cause she 's bittersweet
she knocks me off my feet
and i ca n't help myself
i do n't want anyone else
she 's a mystery
she 's too much for me
but i keep coming back for more
she 's just the girl i 'm looking for

step one you say we need to talk
he walks you say sit down it ’ s just a talk
he smiles politely back at you
you stare politely right on through
some sort of window to your right
as he goes left and you stay right
between the lines of fear and blame
and you begin to wonder why you came
where did i go wrong , i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
where did i go wrong , i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
where did i go wrong , i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life

song over
i never knew
i never knew that everything was falling through
that everyone i knew was waiting on a queue
to turn and run when all i needed was the truth
but that 's how it 's got to be
it 's coming down to nothing more than apathy
i 'd rather run the other way than stay and see
the smoke and who 's still standing when it clears
everyone knows i 'm in
over my head , over my head
with eight seconds left in overtime
she 's on your mind , she 's on your mind
let 's rearrange
i wish you were a stranger i could disengage
to say that we agree and then never change
soften a bit until we all just get along
but that 's disregard
you find another friend and you discard
as you lose the argument in a cable car
hanging above as the canyon comes between
everyone knows i 'm in
over my head , over my head
with eight seconds left in overtime
she 's on your mind , she 's on your mind
and suddenly i become a part of your past
i 'm becoming the part that do n't last
i 'm losing you and its effortless
without a sound we lose sight of the ground
in the throw around
never thought that you wanted to bring it down
i wo n't let it go down till we torch it ourselves
everyone knows i 'm in
over my head , over my head
with eight seconds left in overtime
she 's on your mind , she 's on your mind ...
everyone knows ... she 's on your mind ...
everyone knows i 'm in over my head
my head i 'm over my ...
everyone knows i 'm in
over my head , over my head
with eight seconds left in overtime
she 's on your mind , she 's on your mind
song over
i found god
on the corner of first and amistad
where the west was all but won
all alone smoking his last cigarette
i said where you been , he said ask anything
where were you ?
when everything was falling apart
all my days were spent by the telephone
it never rang
and all i needed was a call
that never came
to the corner of first and amistad
lost and insecure
you found me , you found me
lying on the floor
surrounded , surrounded
why ’ d you have to wait ?
where were you ? where were you ?
just a little late
you found me , you found me
in the end everyone ends up alone
losing her , the only one who ’ s ever known
who i am , who i ’ m not , who i want to be
no way to know how long she will be next to me
lost and insecure
you found me , you found me
lying on the floor
surrounded , surrounded
why ’ d you have to wait ?
where were you ? where were you ?
just a little late
you found me , you found me
early morning , city breaks
i ’ ve been calling for years and years and years and years
and you never left me no messages
you never send me no letters
you got some kind of nerve , taking all i want
lost and insecure
you found me , you found me
lying on the floor
where were you where were you
lost and insecure
you found me , you found me
lying on the floor
surrounded , surrounded
why ’ d you have to wait ?
where were you ? where were you ?
just a little late
you found me , you found me
why ’ d you have to wait ?
to find me , to find me
song over
coming out of my cage
and i 've been doing just fine
because i want it all
it started out with a kiss
how did it end up like this ?
it was only a kiss
now i 'm falling asleep
and she 's calling a cab
and she 's taking the drag
now they 're going to bed
and my stomach is sick
but she 's touching his chest now
he takes off her dress now
let me go
and i just ca n't look
it 's killing me
and taking control
jealousy
turning saints into the sea
turning - swimming - through sick lullaby
joking on your alibi
but it 's just the price i pay
destiny is calling me
open up my eager eyes
i 'm mr. brightside
song over
breaking my back just to know your name
seventeen tracks and i 've had it with this game
i 'm breaking my back just to know your name
anything goes but do n't blink you might miss
cause heaven ai n't close in a place like this
bring it back down , bring it back down tonight
never thought i 'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight
well somebody told me
you had a boyfriend
who looked like a girlfriend
that i had in february of last year
it 's not confidential
i 've got potential
ready ? let 's roll onto something new
taking its toll and i 'm leaving without you
ready ? let 's roll onto something new
anything goes but do n't blink you might miss
cause heaven ai n't close in a place like this
bring it back down , bring it back down tonight
never thought i 'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight
well somebody told me
you had a boyfriend
who looked like a girlfriend
that i had in february of last year
it 's not confidential
i 've got potential
a rushin ' , a rushin ' around
pace yourself from me
i said maybe baby please
but i just do n't know now
when all i wan na do is try
well somebody told me
you had a boyfriend
who looked like a girlfriend
that i had in february of last year
it 's not confidential
i 've got potential
a rushin ' , a rushin ' around
song over
you sit there in your heart-ache
waiting on some beautiful boy to
to save you from your old ways
you play forgiveness
watch it now here he comes
he doesnt look a thing like je-sus
but he talks like a gentleman
like you imagined
when you were young
can we climb this mountain
i dont know
higher now than ever before
i know we can make it if we take it slow
let 's take it easy
easy now , watch it go
we 're burning down the highway sky- line
on the back of a hurricane
that started turning
when you were young
when you were young
and sometimes you close your eyes
and see the place where you used to live
when you were young
they say the devil 's water it ai n't so sweet
you dont have to drink right now b- ? - but you can dip your feet
every once in a little while
you sit there in your heart-ache
waiting on some beautiful boy to
to save you from your old ways
you play forgiveness
watch it now here he comes
he doesnt look a thing like je-sus
but he talks like a gentleman
like you imagined
when you were young
-talks like a gentleman-
-like you imagined-
when you were young
i said he doesnt look a thing like jesus
he doesnt look a thing like jesus
but more than you 'll ever know
song over
this is the clock up on the wall
this is the first sound
of a new born child before he starts to crawl
this is the war that 's never won
this is the mother way to buy
the fall praying for her son
pictures of you
pictures of me
hung up on your wall for the world to see
pictures of you
pictures of me
remind us all of what we used to be
wooah
there is a drug that cures it all
we are the scientists
inside the lab just waiting for the call
this earthquake weather has got me shaking
inside i 'm high up and dry
pictures of you
pictures of me
hung up on your wall for the world to see
pictures of you
pictures of me
remind us all of what we used to be
cause there 's still me
every secret moment
every stolen promise you 've believed
confess to me
all that lies between us
all that lies between you and me
we are the boxers in the ring
there is a title we cant win
no matter how hard we must swing
pictures of you
pictures of me
hung up on your wall for the world to see
pictures of you
pictures of me
remind us all of what we used to be
pictures of you
pictures of me
hung up on your wall for the world to see
pictures of you
pictures of me
remind us all of what we could have been
what could have been
we could have been

all i am is a man
i want the world in my hands
i hate the beach
but i stand in california
with my toes in the sand
use the sleeves on my sweater
let 's have an adventure
head in the clouds but my gravity 's centered
touch my neck and i 'll touch yours
you in those little high waisted shorts
she knows what i think about
and what i think about
one love , two mouths
one love , one house
no shirt , no blouse
just us , you find out
nothing i really wan na tell you about , no
'cause it 's too cold whoa
for you here
and now
so let me hold whoa
both your hands in the holes of my sweater
and if i may just take your breath away
i do n't mind if there 's not much to say
sometimes the silence guides your mind
so move to a place so far away
the goosebumps start to race
the minute that my left hand meets your waist
and then i watched your face
put my finger on your tongue
these hearts adore
everyone the other beat hard is for
inside this place is warm
outside it starts to pour
coming down
one love , two mouths
one love , one house
no shirt , no blouse
just us , you find out
nothing i really wan na tell you about
no no no !
'cause it 's too cold whoa
for you here
and now
so let me hold whoa
both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'cause it 's too cold whoa
for you here
and now
so let me hold whoa
both your hands in the holes of my sweater
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ,
whoa , whoa ...
whoa , whoa ... -x4-
'cause it 's too cold whoa
for you here
and now
so let me hold whoa
both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'cause it 's too cold whoa
for you here
and now
so let me hold whoa
both your hands in the holes of my sweater
it 's too cold , it 's too cold
the hands of my sweater .

i 'm thinking , baby , you and i are undeniable
but i 'm finding now loves unreliable
i 'm giving all i got to make you stay
or am i just a roadblock in your way ?
cause you 're a pretty little windstorm on the boulevard
something like a sunset , oh you 're a shooting star
and i might drive myself insane
if those lips are n't speaking my name
cause i got some intuition ,
or maybe i 'm superstitious
but i think you 're a pretty sweet pill that i 'm swallowing down
to counter this addiction , you 've got me on a mission
tell me darling , can i get a break somehow ?
- how - could i say no ?
she 's got a love like woe - woah-oh , oh-oh , oh-oh -
girl 's got a love like woe - ba-da-da -
i kinda feel like it do n't make sense
because you 're bringing me in and now you 're kicking me out again
love so strong , then you moved on
now i 'm hung up in suspense ,
because you 're bringing me in and then you 're kicking me out again
it 's like a hurricane , speed train , she 's a moving car
catch her in the fast lane , oh i got ta know ,
can i keep up with her pace ?
kick it into gear when i see that face
you can take up all my time cause you 're the only one
that can make a storm cloud break , pulling out the sun
and i ca n't get caught in the rain
can i get your lips to speak my name ?
cause i got some intuition ,
or maybe i 'm superstitious
but i think you 're a pretty sweet pill that i 'm swallowing down

the timing and the moment ,
all seem so right
so would you say you 're mine ? - we 'll be just fine -

hey girl , you know you drive me crazy .
one look puts the rhythm in my head .
still i 'll never understand why you hang around .
i see what 's going down .
cover up with makeup in the mirror ,
tell yourself it 's never gon na happen again .
you cry alone and then he swears he loves you
do you feel like a man when you push her around ?
do you feel better now -- she falls to the ground .
well , i 'll tell you my friend , one day this world 's going to end
as your lies crumble down , a new life she has found .
a pebble in the water makes a ripple effect ;
every action in this world will bear a consequence .
if you wait around forever you will surely drown .
i see what 's going down .
i see the way you go and say you 're right again ,
say your right again
heed my lecture
do you feel like a man when you push her around ?
do you feel better now ? she falls to the ground .
well , i 'll tell you my friend , one day this world 's going to end
as your lies crumble down , a new life she has
song over
i 'm still alive but i 'm barely breathing
just prayed to a god that i do n't believe in
cos i got time while she got freedom
cos when a heart breaks no it do n't break even
her best days will be some of my worst
she finally met a man that 's gon na put her 1st
while i 'm wide awake she 's no trouble sleeping
cos when a heart breaks no it do n't break even , even , no
what am i supposed to do when the best part of me was always you , and
what am i supposed to say when i 'm all choked up that you 're ok , yeah
i 'm falling to pieces , yeah
i 'm falling to pieces
they say bad things happen for a reason
but no wise words gon na stop the bleeding
cos she 's moved on while i 'm still grieving
and when a heart breaks no it do n't break even - even , no -

i 'm falling to pieces
you got his heart and my heart and none of the pain
you took your suitcase , i took the blame .
now i 'm tryna make sense of what little remains , oh
cos you left me with no love , no love to my name .
i 'm still alive but i 'm barely breathing
just prayed to a god that i do n't believe in

am i better off a quitter
they say i 'm better off now
than i ever was with her
as they take me to my local down the street
i 'm smiling but i 'm dying trying not to drag my feet
they say a few drinks will help me to forget her
but after one too many i know that i 'm never
only they can see where this is gon na end
but they all think i 'm crazy but to me it 's perfect sense
and my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'cause i 'm shouting your name all over town
i 'm swearing if i go there now
i can change your mind turn it all around
and i know that i 'm drunk but i 'll say the words
and she 'll listen this time even though
dial her number and confess to her
i 'm still in love but all i heard was nothing
so i stumble there , along the railings and the fences
i know if i 'm face to face that she 'll come to her senses
every drunk step i take leads me to her door
if she sees how much i 'm hurting
she 'll take me back for sure
and my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'cause i 'm shouting your name all over town
i 'm swearing if i go there now
i can change your mind turn it all around
and i know that i 'm drunk but i 'll say the words
and she 'll listen this time even though
dial her number and confess to her
i 'm still in love but all i heard was nothing
she said nothing
oh i wanted words but all i heard was nothing
oh i got nothing nothing
i got nothing nothing
oh i wanted words but all i heard was nothing
oh sometimes love is intoxicating
oh you 're coming down your hands are shaking
when you realise there 's no one waiting
am i better off dead
am i better off a quitter
they say i 'm better off now
than i ever was with her
and my mates are all there trying to calm me down
'cause i 'm shouting your name all over town

i 'm not ... broke i 'm just a broken hearted man ,
i know it makes no sense , but what else can i do ,
how can i move on when i 've been in love with you ...
cos if one day you wake up and find that your missing me ,
and your heart starts to wonder where on this earth i can be ,
thinking maybe you 'd come back here to the place that we 'd meet ,
and you 'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street .
so i 'm not moving ...
i 'm not moving .
policeman says son you ca n't stay her ,

got ta stand my ground even if it rains or snows ,

and maybe you wo n't mean to but you 'll see me on the news ,
and you 'll come running to the corner ...
cos you 'll know it 's just for you

song over
every time we lie awake
after every hit we take
every feeling that i get
but i have n't missed you yet
every roommate kept awake
by every sigh and scream we make
all the feelings that i get
but i still do n't miss you yet
only when i stop to think about it
i hate everything about you
why do i love you
i hate everything about you
why do i love you
every time we lie awake
after every hit we take
every feeling that i get
but i have n't missed you yet
only when i stop to think about it
i hate everything about you
why do i love you
i hate everything about you
why do i love you
only when i stop to think
about you , i know
only when you stop to think
about me , do you know
i hate everything about you
why do i love you
you hate everything about you
why do you love you
i hate
you hate
i hate
you love me
i hate everything about you

this world will never be , what i expected
and if i do n't belong , who would have guessed it
i will not leave alone , everything that i own
to make you feel like , it 's not too late
even if i say , it 'll be alright
still i hear you say , you want to end your life
now and again we try , to just stay alive
maybe we 'll turn it around , 'cause it 's not too late
no one will ever see , this side reflected
and if there 's something wrong , who would have guessed it
and i have left alone , everything that i own
to make you feel like , it 's not too late
even if i say , it 'll be alright
still i hear you say , you want to end your life
now and again we try , to just stay alive
maybe we 'll turn it around , 'cause it 's not too late
the world we knew , wo n't come back
the time we 've lost , ca n't get back
the life we had , wo n't be ours again
this world will never be , what i expected
and if i do n't belong ...
even if i say , it 'll be alright
still i hear you say , you want to end your life
now and again we try , to just stay alive
maybe we 'll turn it around , 'cause it 's not too late

song over
on the other side of a street i knew stood a girl that looked like you
i guess thats deja vu but i thought this ca n't be true cause
wherever to get away from me
oh but that one night was more than just right
i did n't leave you cause i was all through
oh i was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
because i really fell for you
oh i swear to you i 'll be there for you this is not a drive by-i-i-i-i
just a shy guy looking for a two ply hefty bag to hold my i-i-i-i- love
when you move me everything is groovy they do n't like it sue me
umm the way you do me
oh i swear to you i 'll be there for you this is not a drive by-i-i-i-i
on the other side of a downward spiral my love for you went viral
and i loved you every mile you drove away
but now here you are again so let 's skip the `` how you been '' and
get down to the `` more than friends '' at last
oh but that one night is still the highlight
i did n't leave you until i came to
and i was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
because i really fell for you
please believe that when i leave
there 's nothing up my sleeve
but love for you and a little time to get my head together too
on the other side of a street i knew stood a girl that looked like you
i guess thats deja vu but i thought this ca n't be true cause

all my friends are heathens , take it slow
wait for them to ask you who you know
please do n't make any sudden moves
you do n't know the half of the abused
all my friends are heathens , take it slow
wait for them to ask you who you know
please do n't make any sudden moves
you do n't know the half of the abused
welcome to the room of people
who have rooms of people that they loved one day , docked away
just because we check the guns at the door
does n't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
you never know the psychopath sitting next to you
you never know the murderer sitting next to you
you 'll think , `` how 'd i get here sitting next to you ? ''
and after all i 've said , please do n't forget
all my friends are heathens , take it slow
wait for them to ask you who you know
please do n't make any sudden moves
you do n't know the half of the abused
we do n't deal with outsiders very well
they say newcomers have a certain smell
you have trust issues , not to mention
they say they can smell your intentions
you never know the freakshow sitting next to you
you have some weird people sitting next to you
you 'll think , `` how 'd i get here sitting next to you ? ''
but after all i 've said , please do n't forget -watch it-
all my friends are heathens , take it slow
wait for them to ask you who you know
please do n't make any sudden moves

wait for them to ask you who you know -watch it-
all my friends are heathens , take it slow -watch it-

why 'd you come , you knew you should have stayed
i tried to warn you just to stay away
and now they 're outside ready to bust
it looks like you might be one of us
song over
the heart is a bloom
shoots up through the stony ground
there 's no room
no space to rent in this town
you 're out of luck
and the reason that you had to care
the traffic is stuck
and you 're not mo_ving anywhere
you thought you 'd found a friend
to take you out of this place
someone you could lend a hand
in return for grace
it 's a beautiful day
sky falls , you feel like
it 's a beautiful day
do n't let it get away
you 're on the road
but you 've got no destination
you 're in the mud
in the maze of her imagina_tion
you love this town
even if that does n't ring true
you 've been all over
and it 's been all over you
it 's a beautiful day
do n't let it get away
it 's a beautiful day
touch me
take me to that other place
teach me
i know i 'm not a hopeless case
see the world in green and blue
see china right in front of you
see the canyons broken by cloud
see the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
see the bedouin fires at night
see the oil fields at first light and
see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
after the flood all the colors came out
it was a beautiful day
do n't let it get away
beautiful day
touch me
take me to that other place
reach me
i know i 'm not a hopeless case
what you do n't have you do n't need it now
what you do n't know you can feel it somehow
what you do n't have you do n't need it now
do n't need it now
was a beautiful day

crashed on the floor when i moved in
-stay- up too late , and i 'm too thin
-now we're- spinning empty bottles , it 's the five of us
-i- ca n't resist the day -- no , i ca n't resist the day ...
jenny screams out and it 's no pose
beer through the nose on an inside joke
-and- she 's so pretty , and she 's so sure
summer 's all in bloom
-it 's all-right , and it 's nice not to be so alone
but i hold on to your secrets in
white hou-ses
maybe i 'm a little bit over my head
-and- he 's so funny in his bright red shirt
-i- sneak into his car 's cracked leather seat
-boy , we're- going way too fast
-it 's all-right , and i put myself in his hands
but i hold on to his secrets in
white hou-ses
love , or something ignites in my veins
and i pray it never fades , in
white hou-ses
my first time , hard to explain
rush of blood , oh , and a little bit of pain
on a cloudy day , it 's more common than you think
he 's my first mistake ...
maybe you were all faster than me
-these- silly little wounds will never mend
-so i- go , and i will not be back here again
i 'm gone as the day is fading , on
white hou-ses
-i- lied , wrote my injuries all the in dust
in my heart it 's the five of us , in
white hou-ses
-and- you , maybe you 'll remember me
what i gave is yours to keep , in
white hou-ses , in
white hou-ses , in
white hou-ses ...
song over
somewhere there 's speaking
it 's already coming in
oh and it 's rising at the back of your mind
you never could get it
unless you were fed it
now you 're here and you do n't know why
but under skinned knees and the skid marks
past the places where you used to learn
you howl and listen
listen and wait for the
echoes of angels who wo n't return
he 's everything you want
he 's everything you need
he 's everything inside of you
that you wish you could be
he says all the right things
at exactly the right time
but he means nothing to you
and you do n't know why
you 're waiting for someone
to put you together
you 're waiting for someone to push you away
there 's always another wound to discover
there 's always something more you wish he 'd say
but you 'll just sit tight
and watch it unwind
it 's only what you 're asking for
and you 'll be just fine
with all of your time
it 's only what you 're waiting for
out of the island
into the highway
past the places where you might have turned
you never did notice
but you still hide away
the anger of angels who wo n't return
i am everything you want
i am everything you need
i am everything inside of you
that you wish you could be
i say all the right things
at exactly the right time
but i mean nothing to you and i do n't know why
and i do n't know why
song over
and so we talk all night about the rest of life
where we gon na be when we turn 25
i keep thinking time will never change
keep on thinking things will always be the same
but when we leave this year , we wo n't be coming back
no more hanging out 'cause we on a different track
and if ya , got something you need to say
you better say it right now cause you do n't have another day ...
'cause we moving on and we ca n't slow down
these memories are playing like a film without sound
and i , thinking of that night in june
i di n't know of much love ,
but it 's come to soon
and there was , me and you and then we got real blue
stay at home talking on the telephone
and we would get so excited and get so scare
laughing at ourself , thinking life not fair
and this is how it feel ...
as we go on
we remember
all the times we
had together
and as ours life change
come whatever
we will still be
friend forever
so if we get the big jobs and we make the big money
when we look back now will our jokes still be funny ?
will we still remember everything what we learned in school
still be trying to break every single rule ?
will little brainy bobby be the stockbroker man ?
will heather find a job that wo n't interfere with her tan ?
i keep - keep thinking that its not goodbye
keep on thinking its our time to fly
and this is how it feels ...
as we go on
we remember
all the times we
had together
and as ours life change
come whatever
we will still be
friend forever
will we think about tomorrow like we think about now ?
can we survive it out there ?
can we make it somehow ?
i guess i thought that this would never end
and suddenly it 's like we 're women and men
will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round ?
will these memories fade when i leave this town
i keep , i keep thinking that it 's not goodbye
keep on thinking it 's a time to fly
and this is how it feel ... .
as we go on
we remember
all the times we
had together
and as ours life change
come whatever
we will still be
friend forever
as we go on
we remember
all the times we
had together
and as ours life change
come whatever
we will still be
friend forever
as we go on
we remember
all the times we
had together
and as ours life change
come whatever
we will still be
friend forever

oh do n't you dare look back
just keep your eyes on me .

she said shut up and dance with me !
this woman is my destiny

we were victims of the night ,
the chemical , physical , kryptonite
helpless to the bass and faded light
oh we were born to get together ,
born to get together .
she took my arm ,
i do n't know how it happened .
we took the floor and she said
oh do n't you dare look back
just keep your eyes on me .
i said you 're holding back ,
she said shut up and dance with me !
this woman is my destiny
she said oh oh oh
shut up and dance with me

a backless dress and some beat up sneaks ,
my discothèque , juliet teenage dream .
i felt it in my chest as she looked at me .
i knew we were born to be together ,
born to be together
she took my arm ,
i do n't know how it happened .
we took the floor and she said
oh do n't you dare look back
just keep your eyes on me .
i said you 're holding back ,
she said shut up and dance with me !
this woman is my destiny
she said oh oh oh
shut up and dance with me

deep in her eyes ,
i think i see the future .
i realize this is my last chance .
she took my arm ,
i do n't know how it happened .
we took the floor and she said
oh do n't you dare look back
just keep your eyes on me .
i said you 're holding back ,
she said shut up and dance with me !
this woman is my destiny
she said oh oh oh
shut up and dance !
oh do n't you dare look back
just keep your eyes on me .

we 'll write a song
that turns out the lights
when both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
do n't waste your time
speed up your breathing
just close your eyes
we 'll hope it 's not for nothing at all
soft kiss and wine what a pretty friend of mine
nervous and shy for the moment we will come
secret valentine

that turns out the lights
when both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
do n't waste your time
speed up your breathing

morning 's first light
i 'll take care of you tonight

when both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
do n't waste your time
speed up your breathing
just close your eyes
we 'll hope it 's not for nothing at all
when guilt fills your head
brush off rise up from the dead
this is the moment that we
will come alive
brace yourself for love
sweet love , secret love .

that turns out the lights
when both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
do n't waste your time
speed up your breathing
just close your eyes
we 'll hope it 's not for nothing at all nothing at all

there 's a place off ocean avenue
we were both 16 and it felt so right
night , staying up all night
there 's a place on the corner of cherry street
we were both 18 and it felt so right
night , staying up all night
if i could find you now things would get better
we would leave this town and run forever
let your waves crash down on me and take me away , yeah
theres a piece of you that 's here with me
when i sleep i dream and it gets me by
tonight , that you 're here tonight
if i could find you now things would get better
we would leave this town and run forever
i know somewhere , somehow we 'll be together
let your waves crash down on me and take me away , yeah
i remember that look in your eyes
when i told you this was good bye
you were begging me not tonight
not here not now
when looking up at the same night sky
and keep pretending the sun will not rise
we 'll be together for one more night
somewhere somehow
if i could find you now things would get better
we would leave this town and run forever
i know somewhere , somehow we 'll be together
let your waves crash down on me and take me away , yeah
