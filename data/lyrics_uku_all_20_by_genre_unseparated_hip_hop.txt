i 'm sorry if i seem uninterested
or i 'm not listenin ' , or i 'm indifferent
truly i ai n't got no business here
but since my friends are here , i just came to kick it
but really i would rather be at home all by myself
not in this room with people who do n't even care about my well-being
i do n't dance , do n't ask , i do n't need a boyfriend
so you can , go back , please enjoy your party
i 'll be here , somewhere in the corner
under clouds of marijuana , with this boy who 's hollering
i can hardly hear , over this music i do n't listen to and i do n't wan na get with you , so tell my friends that i 'll be over here
oh-oh-oh here , oh-oh-oh here
oh i asked myself , what am i doin ' here ?
oh-oh-oh here , oh-oh-oh here
and i ca n't wait 'til we can break up out
excuse me if i seem a little unimpressed with this
an anti-social pessimist , but usually i do n't mess with this
and i know you mean only the best and your
intentions are n't to bother me , but honestly i 'd rather be
somewhere with my people , we can kick it and just listen to
some music with a message , like we usually do
and we 'll discuss our big dreams , how we plan to take over the planet
so pardon my manners , i hope you 'll understand that i 'll be here
not there in the kitchen , with the girl who 's always gossiping about her friends
so tell them i 'll be here , right next to the boy who 's throwin ' up
cause he ca n't take what 's in his cup no more oh god why am i here ?
oh-oh-oh here , oh-oh-oh here
oh i asked myself , what am i doin ' here ?
oh-oh-oh here , oh-oh-oh here
and i ca n't wait 'til we can break up out of here
hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
some girl talkin ' 'bout her haters , she ai n't got none
how did it ever come to this ? i should 've never come to this
so holla at me , i 'll be in the car when you 're done
i 'm stand-offish , do n't want what you 're offerin '
and i 'm done talkin ' , awfully sad it had to be that way
so tell my people when they 're ready that i 'm ready
and i 'm standin ' by the tv with my beanie low yo i 'll be over here
oh-oh-oh here , oh-oh-oh here
oh i asked myself , what am i doin ' here ?
oh-oh-oh here , oh-oh-oh here
and i ca n't wait 'til we can break up out of here
if you 're ready then i 'm ready yeah yeah
if you 're ready then i 'm ready yeah yeah

brush your hair , fix your teeth
what you wear is all that matters
just another stage , pageant the pain away
this time i 'm gon na take the crown
without falling down , down
pretty hurts , shine the light on whatever 's worse
perfection is a disease of a nation , pretty hurts , pretty hurts
pretty hurts , shine the light on whatever 's worse
trying to fix something but you ca n't fix what you ca n't see
it 's the soul that needs the surgery
blonder hair , flat chest

the pain 's inside and nobody frees you from your body
it 's the soul , it 's the soul that needs surgery
it 's my soul that needs surgery
plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
and you break when the paper sign leaves you in the dark
you left a shattered mirror and the shards of a beautiful girl
pretty hurts , shine the light on whatever 's worse
perfection is a disease of a nation , pretty hurts , pretty hurts
pretty hurts , shine the light on whatever 's worse
trying to fix something but you ca n't fix what you ca n't see

past the infatuation phase .
right in the thick of love
at times we get sick of love
it seems like we argue every day .
i know i misbehave and you made your mistakes
and we both still got room left to grow .
and though love sometimes hurt , i still put you first
and we 'll make this thing work but i think we should take it slow .

cause we 're ordinary people
maybe we should take it slow .

take it slow-oh oh-oh-oh
this time we 'll take it slow
maybe we 'll live and learn , maybe we 'll crash and burn
maybe you 'll stay , maybe you 'll leave , maybe you 'll return
maybe another fight , maybe we wo n't survive
maybe we 'll grow , we never know , baby you and i
we 're just ordinary people
we do n't know which way to go
cause we 're ordinary people
maybe we should take it slow .

story of my life
searching for the right
but it keeps avoiding me
sorrow in my soul
really loves my company
he 's more than a man
and this is more than love
the reason that the sky is blue
but clouds are rollin ' in
and to him i just ca n't be true
and i know that he knows i 'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy
with some other guy
i do n't wan na do this anymore
i do n't wan na be the reason why
everytime i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i do n't wan na hurt him anymore
i do n't wan na take away his life
i do n't wan na be ...
i feel it in the air
as i 'm doin ' my hair
preparing for another date
a kiss upon my cheek
accepts i 'm gon na be out late
i say i wo n't belong
just hangin ' with the girls
a lie i did n't have to tell
because we both know
and we know it very well
'cause i know that he knows i 'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy
with some other guy
i do n't wan na do this anymore
i do n't wan na be the reason why
everytime i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i do n't wan na hurt him anymore
i do n't wan na take away his life
i do n't wan na be ...
our love
his trust
i might as well take a gun and put it to his head
get it over with
i do n't wan na do this
anymore , whoah.. , anymore
i do n't wan na do this anymore
i do n't wan na be the reason why
everytime i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i do n't wan na hurt him anymore
i do n't wan na take away his life
i do n't wan na be ...
