Dm   F
She, she ain't real,
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will,
She is a stranger,
You and I have history,
Or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all,
But, baby, is that really what you want?

Dm
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,
                   Gm
You made a fool out of you,

And, boy, she's bringing you down,
			Bb
She made your heart melt,
		Am
But you're cold to the core,
Gm
Now rumour has it she ain't got your love anymore,

Dm F
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,


She is half your age,
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed,
I heard you've been missing me,
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be,
Like when we creep out and she ain't around,
Haven't you heard the rumours?

Dm
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,
                   Gm
You made a fool out of me,

And, boy, you're bringing me down,
                      Bb                         Am
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core,
      Gm
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for,

Dm F
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,

Rumour has it, ooh,

Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear,

Just 'cause I said it don't mean that I meant it,

So tell them I'll be here, Right next to the boy who's throwin' up

                          F
Deeper than the eyes can find it
                        Am
Maybe we have made her blind
         G                    F
So she tries to cover up her pain 
                  Am
And cut her woes away
                         F
'Cause covergirls don't cry 
                    
After their face is made

Chorus:
               F
But there's a hope 
                               Am
That's waiting for you in the dark
                         F
You should know you're beautiful 
                 Am
Just the way you are
     G                  F
And you don't have to change a thing
                            Am
The world could change its heart
                   F
No scars to your beautiful, 
                        F        
We're stars and we're beautiful
G     F              Am
Oh oh oh    oh oh oh oh
G     F              Am
Oh oh oh    oh oh oh oh
     G                  F
And you don't have to change a thing
                            Am
The world could change its heart
                   F
No scars to your beautiful, 
                        F
We're stars and we're beautiful

Verse:
                  Am
She has dreams to be 
             F
An envy, so she's 

Starving you know, 
 Am             G           F
covergirls eat nothing she says 
                                      Am
"Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything"
                         F
"What's a little bit of hunger?"

"I could go a little while longer," 
 F
She fades away
G          F
She don't see her perfect, 
          Am
She don't understand she's worth it
         F
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
   Am
Oh Oh
   G
Oh oh
       F
So to all the girls that's hurting
       Am
Let me be your mirror, 
                F
Help you see a little bit clearer

The light that shines within

Chorus:
           F
There's a hope 
                               Am
That's waiting for you in the dark
                         F
You should know you're beautiful 
                 Am
Just the way you are
     G                  F
And you don't have to change a thing
                            Am
The world could change its heart
                   F
No scars to your beautiful, 
                        F
We're stars and we're beautiful
G     F              Am
Oh oh oh    oh oh oh oh
G     F              Am
Oh oh oh    oh oh oh oh
     G                  F
And you don't have to change a thing
                            Am
The world could change its heart
                   F
No scars to your beautiful, 
                        F
We're stars and we're beautiful



No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are

No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living

No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star

Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful


Chorus:
           F
There's a hope

Verse:
Bm                               
I like digging holes and hiding things inside them
When I'll grow old I hope I won't forget to find them

'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

I built a home and wait for someone to tear it down
Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running

I can't get the numbers, and play the guessing name

It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same
Em                        G           A              Bm

Everything that I do reminds me of you

           D
And make it OK
        Bm
I miss you
                       Em

All I ever wanted was for you to know

Soaking in the glory of it all

Huddled in the backseat of the car

Remember those walls I built

Well baby they're tumbling down 
                                D
And they didn't even put up a fight

They didn't even make a sound

But I never really had a doubt

It's like I've been awakened

Every rule I had you breakin'

It's the risk that I'm takin'

Baby I can see your halo

You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more

Baby I can feel your halo

Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo -halo- halo

I can see your halo -halo- halo

Woah... 

-same chord pattern throughout the rest of the song-

Hit me like a ray of sun 
Burning through my darkest night 
You're the only one that I want 
Think I'm addicted to your light 
I swore I'd never fall again 
But this don't even feel like falling 
Gravity can't forget 
To pull me to the ground again 

                      Bm
It's like I've been awakened 
                       Gbm

Verse:
               Em   C9    G
If I were a boy
     D             Em    C9    G   D   
Even just for a day
         Em         C9
I’d roll out of bed in the morning
    G                D           Em   C9    G
And throw on what I wanted and go
D                       Em   C9    G
Drink beer with the guys
    D                Em   C9    G   D   
And chase after girls
         Em            C9
I’d kick it with who I wanted
    G             D   
And I’d never get confronted for it
Em             C9           G
Because they’d stick up for me

Chorus:
D              Em   C9    G
If I were a boy
        D                Em   C9    G   D   
I think I could understand
       Em            C9
How it feels to love a girl
  G              D          Em   C9    G
I swear I’d be a better man
D                Em   C9    G
I’d listen to her
        D              Em   C9    G   D   
Cause I know how it hurts
         Em           C9
When you lose the one you wanted
           G             D   
Cause he’s taken you for granted
    C
And everything you had got destroyed

Verse -same as first Verse-:
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone its broken
So they think
that I was sleeping alone
I’d put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she’d be faithful
Waiting for me to come home

Chorus:
D              Em   C9    G
If I were a boy
        D                Em   C9    G   D   
I think I could understand
       Em            C9
How it feels to love a girl
  G              D          Em   C9    G
I swear I’d be a better man
D                Em   C9    G
I’d listen to her
        D              Em   C9    G   D   
Cause I know how it hurts
         Em           C9
When you lose the one you wanted
           G             D   
Cause he’s taken you for granted
    C9                           Em7  Am
And everything you had got destroyed

Bridge:
       C          G        D           Am
It’s a little too late for you to come back
        C         Em
Say its just a mistake
           D             Am
Think I forgive you like that
       C         Em                D   
If you thought I would wait for you
    C
You thought wrong

Chorus -same as previous Chorus-:
But you're just a boy
You don’t understand -yea you don’t understand-
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you’ll wish you were a better man
You don’t listen to her
You don’t care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
    C
And everything you had got destroyed

To finally talk to a girl a little cooler than me.

Verse:
E    
Tonight will change our lives
B
It's so good to be by your side
Abm7
But we'll cry
E    
We won't give up the fight
B
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
Gb    
And they'll think it's just cause we're young
E    
And we'll feel so alive

Chorus:
         Abm7
Throw it away
             E    
Forget yesterday
               B        Gb    
We'll make the great escape
                Abm7        E    
We won't hear a word they say
                    B  Gb    
They don't know us anyway
Db7    
Watch it burn
B
Let it die
E                    Gb    
Cause we are finally free tonight

Bridge:
E    
All of the wasted time
B
The hours that were left behind
Gb    
The answers that we'll never find
Db7    
They don't mean a thing tonight

When I met you in the summer
                Am     Bm     C
To my heartbeat sound
            C     Em     D
We fell in love

Verse 1:
Am             F
Dirty tissues, trust issues
G
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Am                  F
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
G
Little voices in my head
Am              F
Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
G
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
Am                         F
All the souls that I can't listen to,
G
to tell the truth

Chorus 1:
               C          F         G
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
               C         F        G
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
               Am        G
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
  F               Em            D7
A steady place to let down my defenses
    F              G    C
But loving you had consequences

Verse 2:
Am          F
Hesitation, awkward conversation
G
Running on low expectation
Am                 F
Every siren that I was ignoring
G
I'm paying for it

Chorus 1:
               C          F         G
Loving you was young, and wild, and free
               C         F        G
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
               Am        G
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
  F               Em            D7
A steady place to let down my defenses
    F              G    C
But loving you had consequences

Chorus 2:
               C     F        G
Loving you was dumb, dark and cheap
           C       F            G
Loving you still takes shots at me
               Am            G
Loving you was sunshine, but then it poured
    F      Em                   D7
And I lost so much more than my senses
       F              G    C
'Cause loving you had consequences

Verse:
Am

Verse:
                  A                                 D
Stopped me on the corner, I swear you hit me like a vision
               A
I-I-I wasn't expecting
            E                                       A
But who am I to tell fate where it’s supposed to go with it?
                          D
Don't you blink you might miss it
                           A
See we got a right to just love it or leave it, you find it and keep it
       E
'Cause it ain't every day you get the chance to say

Chorus:
A                     D                           A
Oh, this is how it starts, lighting strikes the heart
                     E
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
A                     D                       Gbm
Oh, it could be the stars, falling from the sky
                 E
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

Verse:
           A                                       D
I've never seen it, but I found this love, I wanna feed it
                              A                                   E
You better believe, I'm gonna treat it better than anything I've ever had

'Cause you're so damn beautiful
A                                         D
Read it, it's signed and delivered, let's seal it
                         A
Boy, we go together like peanuts and paydays, Marley and reggae
    E
And everybody needs to get a chance to say

Chorus:
A                     D                           A
Oh, this is how it starts, lighting strikes the heart

     Everything is like a whiteout, 'cause we shicka-shicka-shine down
                                  E
Even when-the-when-the light's out, but I can see you glow
Gbm                             D                        Bm
     Got my head up in the rafters, got me happy ever after
                                   D               - stop -
Never felt this way before, ain't felt this way before

I’d rather be a comma than a full stop

Maybe I’m in the black, maybe I’m on my knees

Maybe I’m in the gap batween the two trapezes

But my heart is beating and my pulses start

Cathedrals in my heart


       D           A             Gbm7   
And we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into

To tell me it’s alright

As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony

And every tear’s a waterfall

Oh

- Am  -     F        G
I used to rule the world 
           C                    Am
Seas would rise when I gave the word 
                     F     G
Now in the morning I sleep alone 
          C                 Am
Sweep the streets I used to own

F - G - C - Am    x2

- Am  -     F         G
I used to roll the dice 
          C                 Am
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
              F            G
Listen as the crowd would sing: 
          C                 Am
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"


- Am  -        F        G
One minute I held the key

Next the walls were closed on me 
                          F        G
And I discovered that my castles stand 
     C                    Am
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand 

  F              G
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
C             Am
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
F                G
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
   C                 Am
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain 
C                     Am              F      G
Once you go there was never, never an honest word

That was when I ruled the world 

F - G - C - Am    x2

It was the wicked and wild wind 
              C               Am
Blew down the doors to let me in. 
                          F        G
Shattered windows and the sound of drums 
       C                    Am
People couldn't believe what I'd become

- Am  -    F      G
Revolutionaries wait 
        C               Am
For my head on a silver plate 
                   F      G
Just a puppet on a lonely string
   C                         Am
Oh who would ever want to be king? 


  F              G
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
C             Am
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
F                G
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield

For some reason I can't explain

I know Saint Peter will call my name ,
   F            G

But I know that this much is true,
                 G                                  Cadd9             
We’ll make it through and I hope you are the one I share my life with,
       G                         Cadd9             
And I wish that you could be the one I die with,
G                               Cadd9                
And I pray that you’re the one I build my home with,
D           Cadd9                  G
I hope I love you all my life.

Chorus:
G                         Am              Cadd9           G
I don’t wanna run away, but I can’t take it, I don’t understand
G          Am                Cadd9                              Em
If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
            D             Am                 Cadd9
Is there any way that I can stay in your eyes?

Bridge:
E               Cadd9                  D                      Cadd9
Cos I miss you body and soul, so strong that it takes my breath away,
        E          Cadd9               D                          G     
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today,
       Em          Cadd9                 D
Cos I love you, whether its wrong or right,
                  G            Cadd9                       D          G
And though I can’t be with you tonight, you know my heart is by your side.

Chorus:
G                         Am              Cadd9           G
I don’t wanna run away, but I can’t take it, I don’t understand
G          Am                Cadd9                              Em
If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
            D             Am                 Cadd9
Is there any way that I can stay in your eyes?

Hope dangles on a string

                    Ab                                       Eb
Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye

And rendered me So iSoloated, so motivated

Up the corners of your lips
                             Bb                          Ab
Part them and feel my finger tipsTrace the moment, fall forever

Defense is paper thin Just,one touch and I'd be in
     Bb                       Bb
Too deep now to ever swim against the current
                 Eb                     Cm
- So let me slip away.. So let me slip away

So let me slip against the current 2x -

Eb                                                Bb
I've practiced this for hours, gone round and round
                                      Cm
And now I think that I've got it all down
                                        Ab
And as I say it louder I love how it sounds
                                   F
Cause I'm not taking the easy way out.

Not wrapping this in ribbons,
                                  Ab
Shouldn't have to give a reason why...

Chorus:
             Eb
It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow

I can't believe that I stayed till today

Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
        Ab                  Bb                   Eb
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise.


Eb                                       Bb
It came out like a river once I let it out
                                    Cm
When I thought that I wouldn't know how
                                      Ab
Held onto it forever just pushing it down
                              F
Felt so good to let go of it now

Not wrapping this in ribbons
                                 Ab
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

Chorus:
             Eb
It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow.
            Bb
I can't believe that I stayed till today
                Cm
There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow
                 Ab                          Bb
There's nothing here in this soul left to say
               Eb
Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
               Bb
God knows we tried to find an easier way
            Cm
Yeah you and I will be a tough act to follow
        Ab                  Bb                     Eb
But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise.


     Eb
Our favorite place we used to go
     Bb
The warm embrace that no one knows
     Cm
The loving look that's left your eyes
        Ab                Bb              Eb
That's why this comes as no, as no surprise.


Eb                                             Bb
If I could see the future and how this plays out
                                    Cm
I bet it's better than where we are now
                                              Ab
But after going through this, it's easier to see the reason why

And you will think, that I've moved on

Am
One, one, one...

Verse:
Am
Talkin' in my sleep at night
              F
Makin' myself crazy
F
-Out of my mind, out of my mind-
Am
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
F
-Too many times, too many times-
Am
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else
F
Nobody else
Am
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
F
I tell myself

Pre-Chorus:
Am
One, don't pick up the phone
F                             G
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Am
Two, don't let him in
F                        G
You'll have to kick him out again
Am
Three, don't be his friend
F                                 G
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
Am                       F                  G
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

Chorus:
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                G
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                  G
I gotta tell them to myself
Am
F                 G
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                 G
I gotta tell them to myself

Verse:
Am
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
F
-Nowhere to turn- no way
-Nowhere to turn- no
Am
Now I'm standing back from it, I finally see the pattern
F
-I never learn, I never learn-
Am
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
F
I do, I do, I do

Pre-Chorus:
Am
One, don't pick up the phone
F                             G
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Am
Two, don't let him in
F                        G
You'll have to kick him out again
Am
Three, don't be his friend
F                                 G
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
Am                       F                  G
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

Chorus:
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                G
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                  G
I gotta tell them to myself
Am
F                 G
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                 G
I gotta tell them to myself

Bridge:
Am
Practice makes perfect
F                G
I'm still tryna' learn it by heart
-I got new rules, I count 'em-
Am
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
F               G
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I
Am
-I got new, I got new, I...-

Pre-Chorus:
Am
One, don't pick up the phone
F                             G
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Am
Two, don't let him in
F                        G
You'll have to kick him out again
Am
Three, don't be his friend

You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
Am                       F                  G
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

Chorus:
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                G
I got new rules, I count 'em

F                  G
I gotta tell them to myself

I got new rules, I count 'em

F                 G
I gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in

Don't, don't, don't, don't

Don't, don't, don't, don't
Am
Don't let him in, don't let him in
F               G
Don't, don't, don't, don't

Verse:

  When I was six years old I broke my leg
D                    G                    Bm         A     
  And I was running  from my brother and his friends
D                  G                   Bm                 A       
  And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
D                 G   Bm                 A
  I was younger  then,  take me back to when I

Pre-Chorus:
G           A                  D
  Found my heart and broke it here
                    G
  Made friends and lost them through the years
G               A                D                  G
  And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
G              A
  But I can't wait to go home

Chorus:
  D           G    Bm         A7sus4
  I'm on my   way, driving at ninety
       D              G     Bm         A7sus4
  Down those country  lanes singing to Tiny Dancer
      D           G           Bm       A7sus4
  And I miss the  way you make  me feel      and it's real
       D               G      Bm        A7sus4             D
  When we watched the  sunset over the castle on the hill

Verse:
D               G               Bm                     A
  Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes

  Running from the law through the backfields and  getting drunk with my friends
D               G                Bm             A
  Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon I did it
D                     G    Bm                 A
Right, I was younger  then,  take me back to when we found

Pre-Chorus:
G          A                    D 
  Weekend jobs and when we got paid
                  G                      G
  We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
             A                       D              G
  Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
G             A
  But I can't wait to go home

Bm              G                   D       A7sus4

I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch

But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now

Wish I'd have written it down the way that things played out

When she was kissing him how? I was confused about

Verse:
    Dbm                 Gbm
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
       A              B
So the bar is where I go
Dbm                      Gbm
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
         A               B
Drinking faster and then we talk slow
     Dbm                       Gbm
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
    A                       B
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
        Dbm                    Gbm
Took my hand, stop, prepare "The man" on the jukebox
    A                B
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Pre-Chorus:
Dbm              Gbm
Girl, you know I want your love
A                      B                 Dbm
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
             Gbm
Come on now, follow my lead
A               B    
I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
Dbm              Gbm
Boy, let's not talk too much
A                    B                Dbm
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
             Gbm
Come on now, follow my lead
A
Come—come on now, follow my lead

Chorus:
Dbm      Gbm                    A
  I'm in love with the shape of you
            B                  Dbm
We push and pull like a magnet do
            Gbm              A
Although my heart is falling too
       B 
I'm in love with your body
Dbm        Gbm                  A
  And last night you were in my room
           B                    Dbm
And now my bedsheets smell like you
                 Gbm                  A
Every day discovering something brand new
            B
Well I'm in love with your body
Dbm Gbm A         B
           I'm in love with your body

 Every day discovering something brand new
       B
I'm in love with the shape of you

Verse:
Dbm                    Gbm
One week in we let the story begin
            A                B
We're going out on our first date
            Dbm                  Gbm
But you and me are thrifty so go all you can eat
             A                   B
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
            Dbm                       Gbm
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
             A                B
And how your family is doin' okay
              Dbm               Gbm
And leave and get in a taxi, we kiss in the backseat
         A                     B
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Pre-Chorus:
Dbm              Gbm
Girl, you know I want your love
A                      B                 Dbm
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on now, follow my lead

Come—come on now, follow my lead

I know I keep my heart protected, far away from my sleeve.
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you.


Cause when you've given up.
When no matter what you do it's never good enough.
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough,
Thats when you feel my kind of love.


And when you're crying out.

Never in my life have i met someone like him
I’m blown away by his love for me
If you ever wonder where it is you’ll find him
You will find him you will find him next to me
Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
You will find him you’ll find him next to me


When the moneys spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can’t seem to find no help or love for free
I know there’s no need for me to panic
Cause I’ll find him I’ll find him next to me

When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
All i need is a helping hand to stop the tears from
falling
I will find him will find him next to me

Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
You will find him you’ll find him next to me

Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
Next to me ooooh
You will find him you’ll find him next to me

A				  	 Dbm
because your presence still lingers here - and it won't leave me alone

I love you to death

Intro: C G Am F

C               G
I can't stand to fly
Am             F
I'm not that naive
C               G
I'm just out to find
Am                F
The better part of me


               C                    G
I'm more than a bird...I'm more that a plane
               Am          F
More than some pretty face beside a train
         C          G   F C
It's not easy to be me


C                G
Wish that I could cry
Am             F
Fall upon my knees
C             G
Find a way to lie
        Am                F
About a home I'll never see


             C                     G
It may sound absurd...but don't be naive
      Am               F
Even heroes have the right to bleed
          C                     G
I may be disturbed...but won't you concede
      Am               F
Even heroes have the right to dream
         C          G   F C G
It's not easy to be me


Am        G          F         Am
Up, up ahead...away from me
          D           Am                 D
It's all right...you can all sleep sound tonight


         F               G
I'm not crazy...or anything...


I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Digging for kryptonite on this one-way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Looking for special things inside of me

It's not easy to be me

Witness I got the heart of 20 men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever can't hold me down
A hundred miles feelin' from the picture smile
Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates,
Take a genius to understand me

It's like everywhere I go
My whistle ready to blow
Shorty don't leave a note

Show me soprano, cause girl you can handle
Baby we start snagging, you come in part clothes
Girl i'm losing wing, my bucatti the same road
Show me your perfect pitch,
You got it my banjo
Talented with your lips, like you blew out candles
So amusing, now you can make a whistle with the music
Hope you ain't got no issue, you can do it
Give me the perfect picture, never lose it

where we both admit we had it good but
Bb               Cm         Gm                   F

Not over you

Verse 2 - SAME AS Verse 1 -:
Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
You took this heart and put it through hell

I I'm a boomerang doesn't matter how you throw me
Turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

But it wasn't because I didn't know enough

And I hope that you are having the time of your life

Ha ha ha bless your soul

You really think you're in control

Chorus - same as first Chorus -:
Well, I think you're crazy!
I think you're crazy!
I think you're crazy,
Just like me.

Verse - same as second Verse -:
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

Chorus - same as first Chorus -:
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

And it tastes like Jack when I'm kissing him

So I told him that I never really liked his friends

Intro: E

Verse:
E                 Dbm
I'm not a perfect person
                               E
As many things I wish I didn't do
               Dbm
But I continue learning
                                   A
I never meant to do those things to you
                              B
And so I have to say before I go
                          E
That I just want you to know

Chorus:
                       Dbm
I've found a reason for me
                        A
To change who I used to be
                        B
A reason to start over new
                   E
and the reason is you

Interlude: E

Verse:
                  Dbm
I'm sorry that I hurt you
                                      E
It's something I must live with everyday
                           Dbm
And all the pain I put you through
                                  A
I wish that I could take it all away
                                     B
And be the one who catches all your tears
                          E
That's why I need you to hear

Chorus:      
                       Dbm
I've found a reason for me
                        A
To change who I used to be
                        B
A reason to start over new
                   E
and the reason is You x4

Bridge:
E                    Dbm  
I'm not a perfect person
E                                   A
I never meant to do those things to you
                               B
And so I have to say before I go
                         E
That I just want you to know

To drain the whole sea

               G    D
When I look into your eyes
                        G     D
It's like watching the night sky
          G        D 
Or a beautiful sunrise
                       A
There's so much they hold
                   G     D
And just like them old stars
                    G      D
I see that you've come so far

To be right where you are

How old is your soul?

                         G    D
And when you're needing your space
           G        D
To do some navigating
                 G        D
I'll be here patiently waiting

To see what you find

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
              G                               A

Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use

And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend

For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
A              A           A 
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
C             C              C
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not

Before the cool done run out I’ll be giving it my best test

Verse:
C
I've been spending' way too long checking' my tongue in the mirror
G
And bending' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
Am
My breath fogged up the glass
F
And so I drew a new face and laughed
C
I guess what I'm a saying’s there isn’t no better reason
G
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons

It’s what we aim to do

Our name is our virtue

So please don’t, don’t please don’t

This is, this is, this is our fate
I’m yours

Intro: C  Am  F  Am

Verse 1:
           C                 Am
I got this feeling inside my bones
        F                              Am
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
               C                    Am
All through my city, all through my home
             F                              Am
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

Refrain:
           C
I got that sunshine in my pocket
              Am
Got that good soul in my feet
            F                            Am
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
  C                                    Am
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
        F                                  Am
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

Pre-Chorus:
              Bb                     C
And under the lights when everything goes
           Bb                        C
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
        Ab                      Bb
When we move, well, you already know
        Fm7                         Ab   
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Chorus:
C                                  Am
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
F      
a feeling good, good, creeping up on you
        Am
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
C  
All those things I shouldn't do
        Am
But you dance, dance, dance
    F                                  Am
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
                 C
I can't stop the feeling
        Am
So just dance, dance, dance
                 F
I can't stop the feeling
        Am
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Verse 2:
C                   Am
Ooh, it's something magical
            F                                   Am
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
                C                     Am
I don't need no reason, don't need control
         F                                Am
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

Refrain:
                 C
Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
              Am
Got that good soul in my feet

I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops

I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally

Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

That we're making two reflections into one
                           Eb
Cause it's like you're my mirror
    Bb                      Ab
-oh oh- My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

-same chords as Chorus-
You are you are the love of my life -x10-

Verse:
               Eb           Bb                Ab
Now you're the inspiration of this precious song
                 Eb                   Bb                   Ab
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
                 Cm              Bb                Ab
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
             Eb                   Bb               Ab
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home

Just to let you know, you are

Verse:
                  Cm       Bb               Fm    Ab
Girl you're my reflection,    all I see is you
      Cm       Bb                 Fm   Ab
My reflection,   in everything I do
             Cm      Bb               Fm    Ab
You're my reflection   and all I see is you
      Cm      Bb                 Fm    Ab
My reflection,  in everything I do

Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
G                                Em7        D   
And every tomorrow, maybe you’ll let me borrow your heart
    G                               Em7   D   
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday      
G                                     Em7       D   
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start

Pre-Chorus:

I know people make promises all the time

When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, and you're bleeding
    G  
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
    Em7           D                G
And I won’t stop until you believe it
                  Em7    D   
Cause baby you’re worth it

Chorus:
G                                      Em7       D   
 So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
G                                          Em7           D

Verse:
                              G     Em7             D   
Now how about I’d be the last voice you hear tonight?
G                         Em7                    D   
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
              Em7          D                        G
Every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me
      Em7                      D   
Cause I know that’s a good place to start

Pre-Chorus:

No I won’t fill your mind

With broken promises and wasted time

And if you fall, you’ll always land right in these arms

These arms of mine

Chorus:

-the same chord progression Am C G Dsus2 throughout the song-


Once upon a time, I met the perfect guy
He had that Colgate smile, he had that suit and tie
Mama always said get a rich boyfriend
You don't gotta love him, girl, you can pretend
You bet I totes believed her, yeah, every word she said
Thought he was gluten-free, but all that I got was bread
Mama always said nice guys finish last
Beat him at his own game, honey, take the cash


Ooh, and what a lucky girl you will be
But no, he didn't do jack for me
I want a bean with the beanstalk
And if the magic ain't right, time to walk


Used to be your baby, used to be your lady
Thought you were the perfect lover
All the harmony went falling out of key, so
Now you gotta find another
Now you're talking crazy saying that you made me
Like I was your Cinderella
You and me are through, though, watch me hit it Solo
I'mma do it acapella, yeah


Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'mma do it acapella, yeah


Out on our first date, he took me gourmet
We hit that Olive Garden, my Little Italy
Daddy always said let the gentleman pay
Never ever go Dutch at the buffet
I saw his bad intention, he didn’t wanna talk
He put the saucy on it -Oops!- time to check my watch
Daddy always said money can't buy class
You don't wanna get stuck taking out trash


Ooh, yeah I guess it wasn't meant to be
Because he didn't do jack for me
I want a bean with the beanstalk
And if the magic ain't right, time to walk


Used to be your baby, used to be your lady
Thought you were the perfect lover
All the harmony went falling out of key, so
Now you gotta find another

Intro: E Dbm A B E

Verse 1:
  E                                Dbm
This is more than a typical kinda thing
                                                    A
Felt the joints in my bones where you were touching me, oh oh
   B                      E
Didn't want to take it slow
 E                                         Dbm
In the days, going crazed, I can barely think
                                              A
You're replaying in my brain, find it hard to sleep, oh oh
   B                      E
Waiting for my phone to blow

 E
Now I'm here in a sticky situation
 E
Got a little trouble, yep and now i'm pacin'
 Dbm
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it's been an hour
 Dbm
Don't wanna think too hard, but i'm sour
A         B                     E 
Oh oh, I can't seem to let you go

Chorus:
E
See i've been waiting all day
                    Dbm
For you to call me baby
       A
So let's get up, let's get on it
           B                          E
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
E
Come on, that's right
E
Honest baby i'll do
             Dbm
Anything you want to
           A
So can we finish what we started
            B                        E
Don't you leave me broken hearted tonight
Come on, that's right

Uh cheerio

Verse 2: - same as Verse 1 -
What's the time, such a crime
Not a single word, sipping on a patron
Just to calm my nerves, oh oh
Poppin' bottles by the phone
Oh yeah
Act me up, pat me down, turn me inside out
That's enough, hold me up
Maybe i'm in doubt, oh oh
Now don't even think you know, no no

-Chorus-

Verse 3:
Anything you wanna do, i'll be on it too
Everything you say, it's like a gold with a view
Business on the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was the outfit really wack
This kinda thing doesn't happen usually
I'm on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it so come and get it

Uh cheerio

-Chorus- 

Outro: 
E
When you gonna call
E
Don't leave me broken hearted
Dbm
I've been waiting up
                                A
Let's finish what we started, oh oh
B                        E
I can't seem to let you go
Come on, that's right

Intro: Ab Bbm Fm Db

Verse:
Ab                Bbm  
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag, 
Fm                         Db
drifting through the wind 
                       Ab
wanting to start again? 
                  Bbm                Fm  
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin 
                     Db
like a house of cards,
                        Ab 
one blow from caving in? 
                 Bbm                   Fm
Do you ever feel already buried deep? 
                          Db                            Ab
6 feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing 
                          Bbm                   Fm
Do you know that there's still a chance for you 
                              Db
'Cause there's a spark in you 

Pre-Chorus:
                Ab          Bbm          Fm     Db 
You just gotta ignite, the light, and let it shine 
     Ab       Bbm             Fm        Db
Just own the night like the 4th of July 

Chorus:
                      Ab    Bbm
'Cause baby you're a firework
                   Fm           Db
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
             Ab          Bbm
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Fm    Db
As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
               Ab    Bbm
Baby, you're a firework 
                   Fm     Db
Come on, let your colors burst 
             Ab        Bbm
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Fm              Db
You're gonna leave 'em falling down-own-own 


Verse -same chords as first Verse-:

You don't have to feel like a waste of space 
You're original, cannot be replaced 
If you only knew what the future holds 
After a hurricane comes a rainbow 

Maybe your reason why all the doors are closed 
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road 
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow 
And when it's time, you'll know 

Pre-Chorus:
                Ab          Bbm          Fm     Db 
You just gotta ignite, the light, and let it shine 
     Ab       Bbm             Fm        Db
Just own the night like the 4th of July 

Chorus:
                      Ab    Bbm
'Cause baby you're a firework
                   Fm           Db
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
             Ab          Bbm
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Fm    Db
As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
               Ab    Bbm
Baby, you're a firework 
                   Fm     Db
Come on, let your colors burst

Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon 
                           Ab           Bbm 
It's always been inside of you, you, you 
                            Fm             Db
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough

Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"

As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
               Ab    Bbm
Baby, you're a firework 
                   Fm     Db
Come on, let your colors burst

- Same chords throughout the whole song -

No, I don't even know your name,
It doesn't matter.
Your my experimental game,
Just human nature.
It's not what good girls do,
Not how they should behave.
My head gets so confused,
Hard to erase.

I kissed a girl,
and I liked it.
The taste of her cherry chapstick.
I kissed a girl,
Just to try it.
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.

It felt so wrong,
It felt so right.
Don't mean i'm in love tonight.

I kissed a girl,
And I liked it.
I liked it

Us girls we are so magical,
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable,
Hard to resist, so touchable.
To good to deny it.
Ain't no big deal,
Its innocent.

I kissed a girl,
and I liked it.
The taste of her cherry chapstick.
I kissed a girl,
Just to try it.
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.

It felt so wrong,
It felt so right.
Don't mean i'm in love tonight.

I kissed a girl,
And I liked it.
I liked it

Bb
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
                            Cm         Gm
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
                           Eb       Bb
So I sat quietly, agreed politely

I guess that I forgot I had a choice
                           Cm            Gm 
I let you push me past the breaking point

You held me down, but I got up
                         Cm 
Already brushing off the dust

Like thunder, gonna shake your ground

You held me down, but I got up

Get ready cause I've had enough
  Gm                      Eb

I got the eye of the tiger, the fighter, 

Dancing through the fire
      Gm                  Cm           Eb        Bb
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar

Louder, louder than a lion
      Gm                  Cm           Eb        Bb
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar

Bb
 Now I'm floatin' like a butterfly
                      Cm               Gm  
Stingin' like a bee I earned my stripes
                            Eb
I went from zero, to my own hero


    Bb
You held me down, but I got up
                         Cm 
Already brushing off the dust
    Gm
You hear my voice, you hear that sound

Used to steal your parent's liquor and climb to the roof
Abm
Talk about our future like we had a clue
      Dbm                                A
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

In another life I would be your girl
                Dbm                        A
We keep all our promises be us against the world

In another life I would make you stay
                   Dbm                            A
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

Never one without the other we made a pact
Dbm                                           A
Sometimes when I miss you I put those records on woah

Abm
Saw you down town singin’ the blues
     Dbm                                       A
It's time to face the music I'm no longer your muse

  Can't replace you with a million rings no

  I shoulda told you what you meant to me woah

Comparisons are easily done
          Dbm              A 
Once you've had a taste of perfection
        E             B
Like an apple hanging from a tree

Tons of fish in the water

He pulled me in

It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
D                  C               G
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
D        C             G
She was 17 and she was far from in between
       D             C        G
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Interlude: D  C  G

   D               C         G    
Splashin' thru the sandbar, talkin' by the campfire
          D                C                  G 
It's the simple things in life like when and where
    D             C             G
We didn't have no internet, but man I never will forget
    D                 C               G
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

Chorus:

And we were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things

Makin' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
        D              C          G
Sippin' whisky out the bottle not thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
        D             C        G            D  C  G
Singin' sweet home alabama all summer long
        D             C        G
Singin' sweet home alabama all summer long


         D                C             G
Catchin' walleye from the dock watchin' waves roll off the rocks
          D             C             G
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
      D             C               G
We'd blister in the sun we couldn't wait for night to come
   D              C                G
To hit that sandy place of rock 'n roll

there's certain things that should be left unsaid,
tick tick tick on the watch and life's too short for me to stop,
Oh baby, your time is running out,

A Dbm

A                                                   Dbm
Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
A                                                  Dbm
Reaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore
      A                            Dbm
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
          A                A
For me it happens all the time

              
       E                                      Abm

E                                                  Abm
Said I wouldn't come, but I lost all control and I need you now
       A                               A                  A Dbm
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now


 A                                                 Dbm
Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door
A                                                 Dbm
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before
      A                            Dbm
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
          A                A
For me it happens all the time


       E                                           Abm
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now
E                                                  Abm
Said I wouldn't come, but I lost all control and I need you now

Yes I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all

To just put aside your feelings

F
Closed off from love I didn’t need the pain
Dm
Once or twice was enough And it was all in vain
Bb                                                  C
Time starts to pass Before you know it you’re frozen


F
But something happened For the very first time with you
Dm  
My heart melted to the ground Found something true
Bb                                                    C
And everyone’s looking round Thinking I’m going crazy


F
But I don’t care what they say I’m in love with you
Dm
They try to pull me away But they don’t know the truth
Bb
My heart’s crippled by the vein That I keep on closing
C
You cut me open and I


F
Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love
Dm
I keep bleeding I keep, keep bleeding love
Bb
Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love
C
You cut me open


-same F  Dm  Bb  C chord pattern throughout the song-


Trying hard not to hear 
But they talk so loud 
Their piercing sounds fill my ears 
Try to fill me with doubt 
Yet I know that the goal 
Is to keep me from falling 

But nothing’s greater 
Than the rush that comes with your embrace 
And in this world of loneliness 
I see your face 
Yet everyone around me         
Thinks that I’m going crazy, maybe, maybe 

But I don’t care what they say
I’m in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don’t know the truth
My heart’s crippled by the vein 
That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I 

Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
You cut me open 

And it’s draining all of me 
Oh they find it hard to believe 
I’ll be wearing these scars 
For everyone to see 

I don’t care what they say 
I’m in love with you 
They try to pull me away 
But they don’t know the truth 
My heart’s crippled by the vein 
That I keep on closing 
You cut me open and I 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love 
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding 
I keep, keep bleeding love 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I 
Keep bleeding 
Keep, keep bleeding love

Like we're holding onto something That's invisible there, 
'Cause we're living at the mercy of The pain and the fear 
Until we dead it, Forget it, Let it all disappear. 


E
Waiting for the end to come 
               Amaj7
Wishing I had strength to stand 
                 E
This is not what I had planned 
                  Amaj7  B
It's out of my controoooool.... 


Flying at the speed of light 
Thoughts were spinning in my head 
So many things were left unsaid 
It's hard to let you go... 



Dbm                           A
- Oh! - I know what it takes to move on, 
Dbm                    A
I know how it feels to lie, 
E
All I wanna do 
    B                                  
Is trade this life for something new 
Dbm                          B    E 
Holding on to what I haven't gooooot 



E
Sitting in an empty room 
             A
Trying to forget the past
                E    
This was never meant to last, 
                Asus2        
I wish it wasn't so... 



- Oh! - I know what it takes to move on, 
I know how it feels to lie, 
All I wanna do 
Is trade this life for something new 
Holding on to what I haven't got 



What was left when that fire was gone? 
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong 
All caught up in the eye of the storm 
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on 
And i don't even know what kind of things I've said 
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead 
So, picking up the pieces, now where to begin? 
The hardest part of ending Is starting again!! 



Interlude: E - E - Dbm - B



All I wanna do 
Is trade this life for something new 
Holding on to what i haven't got... 


E
This is not the end 
This is not the beginning, 
         E
Just a voice like a riot 
Rocking every revision 
    Dbm                        A 
- Holding on to what i haven't got - 
But you listen to the tone 
And the violet rhythm 
Though the words sound steady 
Something empty's within 'em 


We say Yeah! 
With fists flying up in the air 
Like we're holding onto something 
That's invisible there, 
 Dbm                         B   
- Holding on to what i haven't got! -

'Cause we're living at the mercy of 
The pain and the fear 
Until we dead it, Forget it, 
Let it all disappear

Everybody stops and they staring at me
I got passion in my pants and I ain't afraid to show it

When I'm at the moss, purity just can't fight them off
When I'm at the beach, I'm in a speedo trying to tan my cheeks
This is how I roll, come on ladies it's time to go
We headed to the bar, baby don't be nervous
No shoes, no shirt, and I still get service

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
No post code envy

But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,
Cadd9                            G
We don't care, we're driving cadillacs in our dreams.

But everybody's like cristal, maybach, diamonds on your time piece.
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash.
Cadd9                      G
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair.
   

                   D
And we'll never be royals..
It don't run in our blood,

We crave a different kind of buzz.

Let me be your ruler, you can call me queen bee

And baby I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule.

My friends and I we've cracked the code.
We count our dollars on the train to the party.
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this,
We didn't come from money.

            G
We aren't caught up in your love affair.


                    D
And we'll never be royals..
It don't run in our blood,

That kind of lux just ain't for us.

We crave a different kind of buzz.

Let me be your ruler, you can call me queen bee
                Cadd9
And baby I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule.
G

Don't you think that it's boring how people talk
G                         Am                     F
Making smart with their words again, well I'm bored

Never not chasing a million things I want
            G
And I am only as young as the minute is full of it
Am                                                   F

Verse -same as first-:
Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's filling up with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I xxxx with the fun again, when I'm known
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
Everything's cool when we're all in line, for the throne
But I know it's not forever
-Yeah-

-same chord pattern throughout the whole song-

Ridin high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, cause I had everything
Walked away, won me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out darlin

I need you,  to understand
Tried so hard
To be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell
I used to be
Shadow of my life
Was hangin over me

A broken man
Without a throne
Won't even stand the devils dance
To win my soul

Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out darlin

I'm fighting hard
To hold my own
No, I just can't make it
All alone

I'm holdin on
I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring
Is a shade of black

Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out darlin

Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out darlin

Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin, beggin you
Put your loving hand out darlin

Verse 1:
C                                            G
I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world,
                                                Am
But its feeling just like every other morning before,
                                                   F
Now I wonder what my life is going to mean if it's gone,

C                                                  G
The cars are moving like a half a mile an hour and I
                                                    Am
Started staring at the passengers who're waving goodbye
                                              F
Can you tell me what was ever really special about me all this time?


Chorus:
Am                                        F
But I believe the world is burning to the ground
F
Oh well I guess we're gonna find out

C
Let's see how far we've come
G
Let's see how far we've come

Am                                       F

Oh well, I guess, we're gonna pretend,

C                                                G
I think it turned ten o'clock but I don't really know
                                            Am
Then I can't remember caring for an hour or so
                                     F
Started crying and I couldn't stop myself

I started running but there's no where to run to

C                                             G
I sat down on the street and took a look at myself
                                                          Am
Said where you going man you know the world is headed for hell

Say your goodbyes if you got someone you can
F
Say goodbye to

Let's see how far we've come
G
Let's see how far we've come


Bridge:

Gone, gone baby, it's all gone
There's no one in the corner
And there's nobody home
Well it was cool, cool
It was just all cool
Now it's over for me
And it's over for you

Verse:
Ab                              Db             Ab
I never came to the beach, or stood by the ocean
Cm                   Db               Cm                    Db
I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand
                   Ab   Db                      Ab
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
    Db               Ab  Db                      Ab
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
Ab                               Db          Ab
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
Cm                          Db
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
Cm                       Db                        Fm
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

Chorus:

But here I am, next to you
Db              Ab    Cm   Fm Db

Verse:
Ab                          Db               Ab
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
Ab                                Db              Ab
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
Ab                              Db            Ab
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Cm                            Db                      Cm
Hoping that you'll stay the same, and nothing will change
             Db                Ab
And it'll be us, just for a while
     Db       Ab
Do we even exist?
 Db                      Ab         Db                  Ab
That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Ab                              Db           Ab
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
Cm                    Db                       Cm
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
        Db                 Fm
I'd be here writing this song

Chorus:
Cm         Fm   Cm     Fm
But here I am, next to you

Outro:
Ab                                Db             Ab
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Cm                         Db
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
                     Cm
And you're there to save me
                   Db               Ab
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
         Db        Ab
It's a brand new start

Got me tripin out like the sixties
Hippies waitin at the disco tech
And 70s dreaming 80s best
Heafard, beyonce, marilyn madison
Girl youre Thomas just so relaxed

Chorus:
Im over my head Im out of my mind
Thinking I was wrong in the wrong time
Lets start the rewind, everything is so throwback age -I kinda like it like it-

From the silver screen
Youre one of a kind living in a world gone plastic
Baby youre so classic

The pen's in my hand, ending unplanned

Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

So close you can almost taste it

Release your inhibitions

Bbm                     Gb                Db
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
Bbm                Gb           Db
The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake
Bbm                      Gb                 Db
It's the house telling you to close your eyes

Tell her that I miss our little talks

Soon it will be over and buried with our past
Bbm                 Gb                   Db
We used to play outside when we were young - and full of life and full of love -

Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right

Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do. 
Bbm
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon.

Intro: G C Em D  C D G

Verse:
             G 
        Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
            C 
        But bear this in mind, it was meant to be
                Em                           D
        And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
               C         D        G 
        And it all makes sense to me

Verse:
          G 
        I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
                 C 
        When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
            Em                          D
        The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
                 C         D      G 
        But I'll love them endlessly 

Chorus:
Am                               C           Em        D 
        I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
                 C        C             Em             D 
        But if I do, it's you - oh it's you, they add up to
               C                                   G 
        I'm in love with you, and all these little things

Verse:
        G 
        You can't go to bed, without a cup of tea
            C 
        And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
            Em                              D
        And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
                  C        D        G 
        Though it makes no sense to me

Verse:
          G                                                  C 
        I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape

        You never want to know how much you weigh
        Em                          D
        You still have to squeeze into your jeans
            C         D       G 
        But you're perfect to me

Chorus:
Am                               C           Em        D 
        I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth

        But if it's true, it's you - oh it's you, they add up to
               C                                   Am

Bridge:
- Am  -              C                  G                 D

Am                     C                    Em                       D 
        And you'll never treat yourself right darlin', but I want you to
Am                  C       G         D 
        If I let you know I'm here for you
Am                 C                  G      D
        Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

Chorus:
Am                                   C            Em        D 
        And I've just let these little things, slip out of my mouth
                    C             C          Em           D
        'Cause it's you - oh it's you, it's you they add up to
                   C                                   - Am  -
        And I'm in love with you, and all these little things

Chorus:
Am                     C           Em        D 
        I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
                    C          C          Em            D 
        But if it's true, it's you - it's you they add up to

Verse 1
   E                                    
This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
   Abm
It's time to make our move, I'm shakin' off the rust
  E
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
   Abm                                    Dbm   
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
                              A
Steady hands, just take the wheel
                          Dbm
And every glance is killing me
                  A
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead

Chorus

  E
Stop and stare

But I've become what I can't be, oh

 E
Stop and stare
                                 B
You start to wonder why you're 'here' not 'there'
                           Dbm
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
                              A
But fair ain't what you really need
A                       E
Oh, can you see what I see?

Verse 2

- Same Pattern of chords as for Verse 1 -

They're tryin' to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now
Gonna run till you can't walk
Something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down


 E
Stop and stare

I think I'm moving but I go nowhere

What you need, what you need, what you need

Am                       G
You say it's puppy love, We say it's full grown
F                                              G
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
Am                                    G
You can plan a pretty picnic, but you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson


Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin, fine
The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
       F
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
N.Ñ.
Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?
Am
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
    G
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too long
    F
Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could
                                G

Am

G
Askin what happened to the feelin that her and me
F
Had, I pray so much about it need some knee
                               G
Pads, It happened for a reason one can't be
Am
Mad, so know this, know that everything is cool
    G
And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation


F                                           G
 I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
 Am                                     G
 Never meant to make your daughter cry, I apologize a trillion times
F                                           G
 I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real

 Never meant to make your daughter cry, I apologize a trillion times


Speech
"Look at the way he treats me" xxxx, look at the way you treat me
You see your little nosy-ass homegirls done got your ass sent up the creek G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin no more cause my dick all in her mouth

F
Knahm'talkinbout? Jealousy, infidelity, envy

Cheating to beating, in the end to the G they be the same thing
   Am
So who you placin the blame on, you keep on singin the same song
    G
Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

If ten million fireflies

Lit up the world as I fell asleep

Verse:
Fm                        Eb
  I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
Fm                         Db
  She's got a body like an hourglass that's ticking like a clock
Fm                 Eb
  It's a matter of time before we all run out...
Fm                      Db
  When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
Fm
  I waited eight long months
Eb
  She finally set him free
Fm                         Db
  I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Fm                     Eb
  Two weeks and we had caught on fire
             Fm                         Db
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

  Second chances: they don't ever matter, people never change

  Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry that'll never change
Fm                      Eb
  And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
Fm                         Db
  I'm sorry honey, but I'm passing up, now look this way
Fm                             Eb
  Well there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Fm                       Db
  Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
Fm                                   Eb
  They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right

This moment is critical

 When enemies are at your door 

 I'll carry you way from more

G                                  D
Just when I felt like giving up on us
                                       Em    C
You turned around and gave me one last touch
                                G
That made everything feel better
             D
And even then my eyes got better
C                                     
So confused wanna ask you if you love me

But I don’t wanna seem so weak
Em7  G         Cadd9 Dsus4  Am       D
Maybe I've been California dreaming


        G          D
In this California king bed
          Em               C
We're ten thousand miles apart
      G           D                Em                    
I bet California wishing on these stars of your heart

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat. I shouldn't be crying.
               Abm 
Tears were for the weaker days

I'm stronger, now what, so I say, but something's missing

I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again

Em    
There was a time

when i was alone 
C 
Nowhere to go 
       G 
and no place to call home
Em                      G 
My only friend was the man in the moon

Em                G 
Then one night i close my eyes
C               G 
I saw a shadow flying high
Em 
he came to me
         G 
with the sweetest smile
C                     G 
told me he wanted to talk for awhile
          Em        G                 
He said "Peter Pan that's what they call me.
C                     G
I promise that you'll never be lonely."

Don't know how much time has passed
            Ebm                   Ebm            Ebm - Db    
Oh, God it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you that
B                         Db                            Ebm
Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

Verse:

How do you feel, that is the question

But I forget, you don't expect an easy answer
       B                              Db

           Ebm               Ebm                      Ebm - Db    
Like paper dolls and little notes, you can't expect a bit of hope
                 B                    Db    
So while you're outside looking in, describing what you see

Forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

Verse -same chords-:
How much is real? So much to question
An epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything
And if that came from the heart it never did, right from the start
Just listen to the noises -No more silent voices-
Before You tell yourself, It's just a different scene
Remember it's just different from what you've seen

High above me  

Verse -same chords as first-:
She comes to speak to me 
I freeze immediately 
'Cause what she says sounds so unreal 

But somehow I can't believe 
That anything should happen 
I know where I belong 
And nothing's gonna happen 
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah

Intro: D Bm G - 2x -


D
I'm so glad you made the time to see me
Bm
How's life, tell me how's your family
G                        D   A
I haven't seen them in a while
D
You've been good, busier than ever
Bm
We small talk, work and the weather
G                              D  A
You're guard is up, and I know why


Bm                    A
Because the last time you saw me
           D                          G
It's still burned in the back of your mind 
            Bm          A                  G    
You gave me roses and I left them there to die


   D
So this is me swallowing my pride 
            Gbm
Standing in front of you saying 
                    G
"I'm sorry for that night" and I go 
D                A              
Back to December all the time
   D
It turns out freedom ain't
- D  -
Nothing but missing you
Gbm      
Wishing I'd realized what I had 
     G
When you were mine 
       D
I'd go back to December, 
A                           G 
Turn around and make it all right
     Bm               A            
I go back to December all the time


D Bm G - 2x -


D                         
These days I haven't been sleeping
Bm
Stayin' up playing back myself leaving
G                                      D  A 
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
       D            
Then I think about summer all the beautiful times 
Bm
I watch you laughing from the passenger side
G                               D  A
And realized I loved you in the fall


Bm                     A
And then the cold came the dark days
     D                  G
When fear crept into my mind
            Bm                   
You gave me all your love and
      A           G
All I gave you was goodbye


   D
So this is me swallowing my pride 
            Gbm
Standing in front of you saying 
                    G
"I'm sorry for that night" and I go

Turn around and change my own mind

I go back to December all the time


D  Bm G - 2x -
 

            Bm            G 
I miss your tan skin your sweet smile
   D              A
So good to me, so right
            Bm              G
And how you held me in your arms
               D
That September night
                   A           Bm -stop  
The first time you ever saw me cry
                              G -stop
Maybe this is wishful thinking
                          D
Probably mindless dreaming
- D  -                                    A      
If you loved again I swear I'd love you right


       Bm               A               G 
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
          Bm               A           G 
So if the chain is on your door I understand


    D
But this is me swallowing my pride 
            Gbm                             
Standing in front of you saying

Saw you there and I thought
Gm7
Oh my God, look at that face

You look like my next mistake
Bb                          C
Love’s a game, want to plaaaaay?

You can tell me when it's over mmm
                              Gm

Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane

                          Bb                         F
But I got a blank space baby and I"ll write your name


F
Cherry lips, crystal skies
                            Dm
I could show you incredible things

Stolen kisses, pretty lies
                              Gm7
You're the king baby I'm your queen

Find out what you want      
            
Be that girl for a month
Bb                          C        F
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no


-F-                        
Screaming crying perfect storms
                          Dm
I can make all the tables turn

Rose garden filled with thorns

Keep you second guessing
      Bb
Like "Oh my god who is she?"

I get drunk on jealousy
    C
But you'll come back each time you leave
                               Bb
Cause darlin' I'm a nightmare, dressed like a daydream


F                                                        Dm

 You know I haven't seen you around, before


                   G
 'Cause when you're fifteen and 
Em7                       D
 Somebody tells you they love you

 You're gonna believe them

 And when you're fifteen

 Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
     Em7                    D
 Well count to ten, take it in

 This is life before you know who you're gonna be

 At fifteen

Interlude: G C Em7 C    

G                            C    
 You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
         Em7                        C    
 And soon enough you're best friends
G                                C    
 Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
          Em7                          C    
 We'll be out of here as soon as we can
     G                               C                 
 And then you're on your very first date
                Em7                           C    
 And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
            G                             C     
 And you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
              Em7                            C    
 And you're dancing round your room when the night ends
          C    
 When the night ends

                   G
 'Cause when you're fifteen and 
Em7                       D
 Somebody tells you they love you
                 C    
 You're gonna believe them

 And when you're fifteen
  D                   Em7                   C    
 And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
    Em7                           D
 But in your life you'll do things greater than
            G           D        C    
 Dating the boy on the football team
             D
 But I didnt know it at fifteen

Interlude: G C Em7 C D

C              Em7              D
 When all you wanted was to be wanted
                            G                  D         C     D
 Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

G                              C    
 Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
       Em7                            C    
 But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
     G                 C                  Em7
 And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy 
                 C                C    
 Who changed his mind and we both cried

                   G
 'Cause when you're fifteen and 
Em7                       D
 Somebody tells you they love you

 You're gonna believe them

 And when you're fifteen
  D               Em7             C    
 Don't forget to look before you fall
Em7                           D
 I've found time can heal most anything
                    G                  D        C    
 And you just might find who you're supposed to be
          Em7            D           C    
 I didn't know who I was supposed to be
D

 Your very first day, take a deep breath girl

 Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

Chorus -repeat B Gb E-:
Cause they're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls

I told her from the start

Destined to be hard

Break your heart


        B     Gb                     E
I said "Yo, I think you'd better go; I can't take you.

I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age,

But girl I'm not your saviour.
         B                              Gb                        E

Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be

I've never known the loving of a man
       B                         Dbm
but it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand

There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever

They're worth so much more after I'm a goner

And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing

A                                  E            D      A E D

She runs on one hundred proof attitude power

And the more she ignores me the more I adore her

Step one you say we need to talk

He walks you say sit down it’s just a talk
             F             Gm
He smiles politely back at you
             F       F        Bb
You stare politely right on through
               F            Gm
Some sort of window to your right
             F       F        Bb
As he goes left and you stay right
              F               Gm
Between the lines of fear and blame
                   F     F         
And you begin to wonder why you came

Chorus:
  Eb             F                Gm
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            Bb             F  
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    Eb                   F                Gm
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             Bb             F  
Had I known how to save a life

Verse -same as first-:
Let him know that you know best
Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you’ve told him all along
And pray to God he hears you

Chorus:
  Eb             F                Gm
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend

Somewhere along in the bitterness

And I would have stayed up with you all night
             Bb             F  
Had I known how to save a life

Verse -same as first-:
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you’ve followed
He will do one of two things 
He will admit to everything
Or he’ll say he’s just not the same
And you’ll begin to wonder why you came

Chorus:
  Eb             F                Gm
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend

On the other side of a street I knew stood a girl that looked like you 
E                         B
I guess thats deja vu but I thought this can't be true cause 
Dbm                       A
You moved to west L.A or New York or Santa Fe or 
E                         B
Wherever to get away from me

Dbm                    A
Oh but that one night was more than just right
E                  B 
I didn't leave you cause I was all through 
Dbm                   A
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell 
E                B
Because I really fell for you

Just a shy guy looking for a two ply Hefty bag to hold my i-i-i-i- love 
A                E                    B                               
When you move me everything is groovy they don't like it sue me 
Dbm              B

Oh I swear to you I'll be there for you this is not a drive by-i-i-i-i


Dbm                                     A
On the other side of a downward spiral my love for you went viral 
E                          B
And I loved you every mile you drove away 
Dbm                            A
But now here you are again so let's skip the "how you been" and 
E                             B
Get down to the "more than friends" at last

Dbm                    A
Oh but that one night is still the highlight 
E                  B
I didn't leave you until I came to
Dbm                    A
And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell 
E                B
Because I really fell for you

Please believe that when I leave 
        Dbm            A                   
There's nothing up my sleeve 
             B
But love for you and a little time to get my head together too


Dbm                                   A
On the other side of a street I knew stood a girl that looked like you

 C
 Crashed on the floor when I moved in 

 This little bungalow with some strange new friends
        C  
 -Stay- up too late, and I'm too thin
 
 We promise each other it's 'til the end
             Am
 -Now we're- spinning empty bottles, it's the five of us 

 With pretty eyed-boys girls die to trust
     G
 -I- can't resist the day--no, I can't resist the day...

Verse:
 C
 Jenny screams out and it's no pose

 'Cause when she dances she goes and goes
 C  
 Beer through the nose on an inside joke
 
 I'm so excited, I haven't spoken
       Am
 -And- she's so pretty, and she's so sure

 Maybe I'm more clever than a girl like her
 G 
 Summer's all in bloom 

 Summer's ending soon...

Chorus:
             F             Am          G

Verse:
C
 Maybe I'm a little bit over my head

 I come undone at the things he said
       C  
 -And- he's so funny in his bright red shirt

 We were all in love, and we all got hurt
     Am
 -I- sneak into his car's cracked leather seat

 The smell of gasoline in the summer heat,
              G
 -Boy, we're- going way too fast

 It's all too sweet to last...

Chorus:
             F          Am    G
 -It's all-right, and I put myself in his hands

 But I hold on to his secrets in 
 C     Am  G

 Love, or something ignites in my veins

Bridge:
F   C      Am      G 
 My  first   time,  hard to explain

 Rush of blood, oh,   and a little bit of pain

Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

-Hook-
Dm     Am
Yeah, ahuh
You know what it is
Gm
Everything I do, yeah I do it big
Yeah ahuh
Screamin that's nothin'
When I pulled off the lot, that stuntin'
Rep up in my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I"m in
Black and yellow

Verse:
Uh, black stripe, yellow paint
Them niggas scared of it but them hoes ain't
Soon as I hit the club, look at them hoes' face
Put the pedal once make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roaring
It’s the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checking game, I’m balling out on every level
Hear them haters talk but there’s nothing you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em, nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start

-Hook-

Verse:
Got a call from my jeweler, this just in
And bitches love me cause I'm xxxxing with their best friends
Not a lesbian, but she a freak though
Come stay for one night, I’m shining all week ho
I’m sippin' Clicquot and rocking yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in my watch I can’t tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up cause every nigga that I’m with Taylored

-Hook-

Bridge:
Stay high like how I’m supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds can’t get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean but its super mean
She wanna xxxx with them cats
Smoke weed, count stacks
Get fly and take trips and that's that
Real rap, I let her get high if she want she feel
Convertible drop feel, ‘87 the top peel back
