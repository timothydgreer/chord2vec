Intro: Dbm

Verse:
    Dbm         Gbm
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
   Dbm                    Ab
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Dbm            Gbm
Truly I ain't got no business here
    Dbm                         Ab
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
    Dbm                          Gbm
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
            Dbm                             Ab
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
  Dbm                      Gbm
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
   Dbm                Ab
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
        Dbm    Gbm
I'll be here, Somewhere in the corner
      Dbm                             Ab
Under clouds of marijuana, With this boy who's hollering
             Dbm              Gbm
I can hardly hear, Over this music I don't listen to
    Am                            E                                  Am -plays into Chorus-
And I don't wanna get with you, So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Chorus:
         Gbm             Dbm
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
     Ab                             Dbm
Oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
         Gbm             Dbm
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
            Ab
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out

Verse:
  Dbm                  Gbm
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
   Dbm                        Ab
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
    Dbm              Gbm
And I know you mean only the best and your
  Dbm                               Ab
Intentions aren't to bother me, But honestly I'd rather be
Dbm                               Gbm
Somewhere with my people, We can kick it and just listen to
     Dbm                             Ab
Some music with a message, like we usually do
                      Dbm                         Gbm
And we'll discuss our big dreams, How we plan to take over the planet
   Dbm                   Ab                                   Dbm
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Gbm                                 Dbm                           Ab
Not there in the kitchen, With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
                     Dbm    Gbm                                   Dbm
So tell them I'll be here, Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
                                  Ab
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
                Am -plays into Chorus-
Oh God why am I here?

Chorus:
         Gbm             Dbm
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
     Ab                             Dbm
Oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
         Gbm             Dbm
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
            Ab
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Bridge:
Gbm                       Dbm                  
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Ab
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
    Gbm                          Dbm
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
   E                                                -mute until Dm-
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
                                          Gbm
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
               Dbm             Ab                     Dbm
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
                               Gbm
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
        Dbm                         Ab
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
                Am -plays into Chorus-
Yo I'll be over here

Chorus:
         Gbm             Dbm
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
     Ab                             Dbm
Oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
         Gbm             Dbm
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
            Ab                                Dbm
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
          Gbm                        Dbm
If you're ready then I'm ready yeah yeah

Same old story is back again
Eb
She's not a lover, she's just a friend
    Db         Cm     BbM               Fm  
I'm sick and tired for you to blame on me
FM
Now you think it's funny
              Eb
Now you wanna spend your money, on girls 
         Db          Cm       BbM
But you forgot when you were down
              Fm
That I was around

Call my love, hang up, call again
What in the world is happening
Listen in, but don't yell at me
Isn't it ironic all you wanna do is smoke chronic
Boy, you forgot when you were down
Who was around

- I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore

Memories don't live like people do
I'm sick for ever believing you
Wish you'd bring back the man I knew
Was good to me, oh Lord
Everytime you say you're coming
Boy, you disappoint me, honey
How well you forgot when you were down
And I was around

- I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore

- I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore

One of these days, it's gonna happen to you
Missing a love like I'm missing you, babe yeah yeah
One of these days, when your dreams come true
That's the one that's gonna do it to you
Oh oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

- I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore

Verse 1:
Am                    C                   
Came into this world, daddy's little girl
    G                           F
And daddy made a soldier out of me -ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-
Am                       C                 
Daddy made me dance, and daddy held my hand -ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-
    G                               F
And daddy liked his whisky with his tea
    Am                   C                       
And we rode motorcycles, blackjack, classic vinyl
G                           F
Tough girl is what I had to be

Pre-Chorus 1:
        Am                        C                        
He said take care of your mother, watch out for your sister
G                         F
Oh that's when he gave to me

Chorus 1:
         Am                             C      
With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
                 G                       Am
Oh my daddy said shoot, oh my daddy said shoot
         Am                          C
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
              G                       Am
My daddy said shoot, oh my daddy said shoot
   Am                          C
He held me in his arms, and he taught me to be strong
   G                                      F    
He told me when he's gone, here's what to do
     Am                             C
When trouble comes to town, and men like me come around
                 G                       Am
Oh my daddy said shoot, oh my daddy said shoot

  -ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-
Am                      C                  
Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right
    G                              F
But he said girl it's your second amendment -ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-
   Am                         C                
He always played it cool, but daddy was no fool
    G                              F    
And right before he died he said remember

Pre-Chorus 2:
   Am                             C                         
He said take care of your mother, watch out for your sister 
G                           F
That's when daddy looked at me

Chorus 2:
         Am                             C      
With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry

Oh my daddy said shoot, oh my daddy said shoot
         Am                          C
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
              G                       Am
My daddy said shoot, oh my daddy said shoot
      Am                          C
Cause he held me in his arms, and he taught me to be strong
       G                                      F    
And he told me when he's gone, here's what to do
     Am                             C
When trouble comes to town, and men like me come around

My daddy warned me about men like you, he said baby girl

He's playing you, he's playing you -ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-

He's playing you, he's playing you -ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-

Oh my daddy said shoot, oh my daddy said shoot -ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-

Because they’d stick up for me

Chorus:
D              Em   C9    G
If I were a boy
        D                Em   C9    G   D   
I think I could understand
       Em            C9
How it feels to love a girl
  G              D          Em   C9    G
I swear I’d be a better man
D                Em   C9    G
I’d listen to her
        D              Em   C9    G   D   
Cause I know how it hurts
         Em           C9
When you lose the one you wanted
           G             D   
Cause he’s taken you for granted
    C
And everything you had got destroyed

Verse -same as first Verse-:
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone its broken
So they think
that I was sleeping alone
I’d put myself first
And make the rules as I go
Cause I know that she’d be faithful
Waiting for me to come home

Chorus:
D              Em   C9    G
If I were a boy
        D                Em   C9    G   D

Bridge:
       C          G        D           Am
It’s a little too late for you to come back
        C         Em
Say its just a mistake
           D             Am
Think I forgive you like that
       C         Em                D   
If you thought I would wait for you
    C
You thought wrong

Chorus -same as previous Chorus-:
But you're just a boy
You don’t understand -yea you don’t understand-
How it feels to love a girl
Someday you’ll wish you were a better man
You don’t listen to her
You don’t care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
Cause you've taken her for granted
    C
And everything you had got destroyed

I know sometimes I get angry, and I say what i don't mean.
I know I keep my heart protected, far away from my sleeve.
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you.


Cause when you've given up.
When no matter what you do it's never good enough.
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough,
Thats when you feel my kind of love.


And when you're crying out.
When you fall and then can't pick, you're heavy on the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around.
That's when you feel my kind of love.


Cause when you've given up.
When no matter what you do it's never good enough.
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough,
Thats when you feel my kind of love.

If you ever wonder where it is you’ll find him
You will find him you will find him next to me

When the moneys spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can’t seem to find no help or love for free
I know there’s no need for me to panic
Cause I’ll find him I’ll find him next to me

When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
All i need is a helping hand to stop the tears from
falling
I will find him will find him next to me

Next to me ooooh

Bbmaj7
Girl I'm in love with you
Ebmaj7
This ain't the honeymoon
Ebmaj7               Fmaj7
Past the infatuation phase.
Bbmaj7
Right in the thick of love
Ebmaj7
At times we get sick of love
Ebmaj7                        Fmaj7
It seems like we argue every day.
       Bbmaj7                   Ebmaj7                         
I know I misbehave and you made your mistakes
       Ebmaj7                      Fmaj7
and we both still got room left to grow.  
           Bbmaj7                   Ebmaj7 
And though love sometimes hurt, I still put you first
        Ebmaj7                      Fmaj7
and we'll make this thing work but I think we should take it slow.


Chorus:

Verse:
Bbmaj7
This ain't a movie naw
Ebmaj7
No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
Ebmaj7               Fmaj7
It gets more confusing every day.

Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we, head back to hell again
We kiss, then we make up all the way.

I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just like walking away.

As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay...

Bridge:
Bbm                       Ebm   
Maybe we'll live and learn, maybe we'll crash and burn
Fmaj7
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave, maybe you'll return
Bbm                 Ebm   
Maybe another fight, maybe we won't survive

Maybe we'll grow, we never know, baby you and I

Pretty lady

When you walk by...


F                                                      Am
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow day
F             Am
When you walk by
              F                                        Am        F   Am
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow day
F     Am                               F
I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye


          Am                                 F
And then something strawberry filled up the sky
       Am                  F          Am
And everything on you intoxicates

It's a mystery,
        F        Am                              F
I don't know why I let you kick in my "Do not disturb" sign
       Am                               F
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
    Am                                  F       Am
And I could tell it's pure just by the taste

And you kiss me


   F                                     Am
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
F                                      Am
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
F                                      Am
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste, love the taste
           F                              Am
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way


      F                  Am
'Cause she's just like nothing
       F            Am
That I ever seen before,
      F                  Am
Baby please don't change nothing
            F              Am
Because your flavor's so original



And it all started when she said
F                Am               F                             Am

We're making love like professionals on the first time
       Am                      F
Acting all professional but it works out
        Am                       F           Am
'Cause you don't wanna work here anyway
         F     Am                          F

Listen
Your true beauty's description looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame

Drom your head to your toes, Out of control, baby you know

If I was ya man - baby you -
Never worry bout - what I do -
I'd be coming home - back to you -
Every night doin' you right
You're the type of woman - deserves good thangs -
Wrist full of diamonds - hand full of rings -
Baby you're a star - I just want to show you, you are -

Intro:
Em - Top 4 strings picked slowly down then up - x 4

Verse 1:
Em
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
                                                 Am
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
                                   Em
Who will dance on the floor in the round
                  Am                                      Em
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
                                                           Am
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
                                   Em
Who will dance on the floor in the round


Bridge:
C                        Em
People always told me be careful of what you do
      C                               Em
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
    C                        Em
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
       C                                 B7
And be careful of what you do before the lie becomes the truth

Chorus:
Em     Am      Em     G       Em
Billie Jean is not my lover
             Am       Em                 Am  Bm
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
        G      Bm7    Em
But the kid is not my son
                  Am
She says I am the one
        G      Bm7    Em
But the kid is not my son

Verse 2:
Em
For forty days and for forty nights. The law was on her side.
                                                        Am
But who can stand when she's in demand. Her schemes and plans.
                                     Em
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
                    Am                             Em
So take my strong advice, remember to always think twice
- Do think twice -

Verse 3:
Em
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
                                                     Am
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine
                                     Em
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round

Bridge:
C                        Em
People always told me be careful of what you do
      C                               Em
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
         C                      Em
Then she stood right by me. The smell of sweet perfume.
     C                           B7
This happened much too soon. She called me to her room.

Chorus:
Em     Am      Em     G       Em
Billie Jean is not my lover
             Am       Em                 Am  Bm
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
        G      Bm7    Em
But the kid is not my son
                  Am
She says I am the one
        G      Bm7    Em
But the kid is not my son
                    Am                             Em
So take my strong advice, remember to always think twice
- Do think twice -

King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream
Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing

On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever

Verse 1
Am                Em
Dig if u will the picture
   Em                   Am
Of u and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can u my darling
Can u picture this?


VRESE 2 -Am  Em  Em  Am-
Dream if u can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you


Chorus -Am  Em  Em  Am-
How can u just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just 2 demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father 2 bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied 
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like when doves cry

Touch if u will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you 
Even doves have pride

It's basically Em-G-D-C throughout the whole song.


Turn the lights on!

Ohhh wo-oh, Ohhh wo-oh

Em                             G
We share, somethin' so charming, still so rare,
           D                        C
and I'm in awe, never been here before,

Repeat Em-G-D-C throughout whole song
Em                           G
so high, we're still climbing,
                       D   
even here inside these walls, 
                     C
breaking each others hearts,
And we don't care cause we're so

In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this f*ck*n' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

Ohhh wo-oh, never never never knew love - Ohhh wo-oh - would hurt this f*ck*n' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

Outta times when I know I should be smiling
Seems to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we still suffering
Cause i'm slowly breaking down
Even when I hold you close
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way

In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this f*ck*n' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

Ohhh wo-oh, never never never knew love - Ohhh wo-oh - would hurt this f*ck*n' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

And it hurts,
Cause I wanna leave, and you wanna leave
But the loves keeps us together

And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way

In too deep, can't think about giving it up
But I never knew love would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much
Cause I never knew love would hurt this f*ck*n' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

Ohhh wo-oh, never never never knew love - Ohhh wo-oh - would hurt this f*ck*n' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

Her head is on my chest, sun comes rolling in
                     F                          Am
We're lost in these covers and all I feel is skin
                                          C        F
I slowly kiss your face, beautiful in every way, you are


C
See I'm a man that don't believe in much
F
But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us
Am
And how we play a fight up in the bathroom

Next thing I know, I'm making love to you

Girl, promise me you'll never change

                     F                          Am
With a smile like the sunset, and the ocean as her hair

Oooooh what she do ain't fair oooh
C                              F
She know me better than I know myself hmmmn

See I'm a man that don't believe in much

But I'll be damned if I don't believe in us

And the tears dropped from your eyes
F                      B
Girl don't you ever change

Every breathe I breath, for the life I need

That can keep me away from you

And there's nobody that could ever compare to you

Black and yellow

Verse:
Uh, black stripe, yellow paint
Them niggas scared of it but them hoes ain't
Soon as I hit the club, look at them hoes' face
Put the pedal once make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roaring
It’s the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checking game, I’m balling out on every level
Hear them haters talk but there’s nothing you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em, nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start

-Hook-

Verse:
Got a call from my jeweler, this just in
And bitches love me cause I'm xxxxing with their best friends
Not a lesbian, but she a freak though
Come stay for one night, I’m shining all week ho
I’m sippin' Clicquot and rocking yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in my watch I can’t tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up cause every nigga that I’m with Taylored

-Hook-

Bridge:
Stay high like how I’m supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds can’t get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean but its super mean
She wanna xxxx with them cats
Smoke weed, count stacks
Get fly and take trips and that's that
Real rap, I let her get high if she want she feel
Convertible drop feel, ‘87 the top peel back
