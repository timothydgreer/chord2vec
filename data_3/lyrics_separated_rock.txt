i hate this town , it 's so washed up
and all my friends do n't give a xxxx
they 'll tell me that it 's just bad luck
when will i find where i fit in
remember when i tried
i 'd never strayed too far from you
forever by your side
no matter what i was going through
but now i never know the things to say to you
that help me prove that i 'm still on your side
i never show just what you do to me
guess i 'm what 's always wrong
i hate this town , it 's so washed up
and all my friends do n't give a xxxx
they 'll tell me that it 's just bad luck
when will i find where i fit in
i hate this town
cause no one can understand ,
i just ca n't be tied down
nothing comes between me and my plans
so now i never know the things to say to you
that help me prove that i 'm still on your side
i never show just what you do to me
guess i 'm what 's always wrong
i hate this town , it 's so washed up
and all my friends do n't give a xxxx
they 'll tell me that it 's just bad luck
when will i find where i fit in
and do n't believe a word they 're telling to you
do n't believe a word they 're telling to you
they let me down
when will i find where i fit in
wo n't let a world gone mad ever bring me down
gave everything i had to turn it back around cause our time 's worth something
bigger than both you and me
i ca n't live my life always backing down
i got ta do this right so they ca n't make a sound cause i 'm not here for nothing
least i can say i stand for something
you and me we stand for something
i hate this town , it 's so washed up
and all my friends do n't give a xxxx
they 'll tell me that it 's just bad luck
when will i find where i fit in
and do n't believe a word they 're telling to you
do n't believe a word they 're telling to you
they let me down
when will i find where i fit in

there 's a fire starting in my heart ,
reaching a fever pitch and it 's bringing me out the dark
finally , i can see you crystal clear .
go ahead and sell me out and i 'll lay your ship bare .
see how i leave , with every piece of you
do n't underestimate the things that i will do .
there 's a fire starting in my heart ,
reaching a fever pitch and it 's bringing me out the dark
the scars of your love , remind me of us .
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
the scars of your love , they leave me breathless
i ca n't help feeling ...
we could have had it all ... - i wish you , never had met me - ...
rolling in the deep - tears are gon na fall , rolling in the deep -
your had my heart ... - i wish you - ... inside of your hand - never had met me -
and you played it ... - tears are gon na fall - ... to the beat - rolling in the deep -
baby i have no story to be told ,
but i 've heard one of you and i 'm gon na make your head burn .
think of me in the depths of your despair .
making a home down there , as mine sure wo n't be shared .
the scars of your love , remind me of us .
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
the scars of your love , they leave me breathless
i ca n't help feeling ...

bless your soul , you 've got your head in the clouds ,
you made a fool out of you ,

song over
i let it fall , my heart ,
and as it fell , you rose to claim it ,
it was dark and i was over ,
until you kissed my lips and you saved me ,
my hands , they 're strong ,
but my knees were far too weak ,
to stand in your arms
without falling to your feet ,
but there 's a side to you that i never knew , never knew ,
all the things you 'd say , they were never true , never true ,
and the games you 'd play , you would always win , always win ,
but i set fire to the rain ,
watched it pour as i touched your face ,
well , it burned while i cried ,
'cause i heard it screaming out your name , your name ,
when lay with you
i could stay there , close my eyes ,
feel you here forever ,
you and me together , nothing is better ,
but there 's a side to you that i never knew , never knew ,
all the things you 'd say , they were never true , never true ,
and the games you 'd play , you would always win , always win ,
but i set fire to the rain ,
watched it pour as i touched your face ,
well , it burned while i cried ,
'cause i heard it screaming out your name , your name ,
i set fire to the rain ,
and i threw us into the flames ,
well , i felt something die ,
'cause i knew that that was the last time , the last time ,
sometimes i wake up by the door ,
and heard you calling , must be waiting for you ,
even now when we 're already over ,
i ca n't help myself from looking for you ,
but i set fire to the rain ,
watched it pour as i touched your face ,
well , it burned while i cried ,
'cause i heard it screaming out your name , your name ,
i set fire to the rain ,
and i threw us into the flames ,
well , i felt something die ,
'cause i knew that that was the last time , the last time ,
song over
i heard that you 're settled down
that you found a girl
and you 're married now
i heard that your dreams came true
guess she gave you things
i did n't give to you
old friend why are you so shy
it ai n't like you to hold back
or hide from life
i hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but
i 'd hoped you 'd see my face
and that you 'd be reminded that for me it is n't over
never mind , i 'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
do n't forget me i beg i re-member you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead , yeah
you 'd know how time flies
only yesterday
was the time of our lives
we were born and raised
in a summer haze
bound by the surprise of our glory days
i hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but
i could n't stay away i could n't fight it
i 'd hoped you 'd see my face
and that you 'd be reminded that for me it is n't over
never mind , i 'll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
do n't forget me i beg i re-member you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead , yeah
nothing compares no worries or cares
regrets and mistakes their memories make
who would have known how
bitter-sweet this would taste
never mind i ’ ll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
do n't forget me i beg i re-member you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
never mind i ’ ll find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
do n't forget me i beg i re-member you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

you know i 'm not one to break promises
i do n't want to hurt you but i need to breathe
at the end of it all , you 're still my best friend
but there 's something inside that i need to release
which way is right , which way is wrong
how do i say that i need to move on
you know we have is separate way
and it feels like i am just too close to love you
there ai n't nothing i can really say
i ca n't lie no more , i ca n't hide no more
got to be true to myself
and it feels like i am just too close to love you
so i 'll be on my way
you 've given me more than i can return
yet there oh so much that you deserve
nothing to say , nothing to do ,
nothing to give
i must leave without you
you know we have is separate way
and it feels like i am just too close to love you
there ai n't nothing i can really say

i like digging holes and hiding things inside them when i 'll grow old i hope i wo n't forget to find them
'cause i 've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
i built a home and wait for someone to tear it down then pack it up in boxes , head for the next town running
'cause i 've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night
and a thousand times i 've seen this road ,
i 've got no roots , but my home was never on the ground
i 've got no roots uuuh uuuh uh uh

and a thousand times i 've seen this road ,
i 've got no roots , but my home was never on the ground

businessmen drink my blood
like the kids in art school said they would
and i guess i 'll just begin again
you say can we still be friends
if i was scared , i would
and if i was bored , you know i would
and if i was yours , but i 'm not
all the kids have always known
that the emperor wears new clothes
but to bow to down to them anyway
is better than to be alone
if i was scared , i would
and if i was bored , you know i would
and if i was yours , but i 'm not
now you 're knocking at my door
saying please come out against the night
but i would rather be alone
than pretend i feel alright
if the businessmen drink my blood
like the kids in art school said they would
then i guess i 'll just begin again
you say can we still be friends
if i was scared , i would
and if i was pure , you know i would
and if i was yours , but i 'm not
now i 'm ready to start
if i was scared , i would
and if i was pure , you know i would
and if i was yours , but i 'm not

i would rather be wrong
than live in the shadows of your song
my mind is open wide
and now i 'm ready to start
and now i 'm ready to start
my mind is open wide
and now i 'm ready to start
your mind surely opened the door
to step out into the dark
now i 'm ready
song over
trapped in a prison , in a prison of light
alone in the darkness , the darkness of white
we fell in love , alone on a stage
in the reflective age
entre la nuit , la nuit et l'aurore
entre le royaume , des vivants et des morts
if this is heaven i do n't know what its for
if i ca n't find you there i do n't care
i thought i found a way to enter
its just a reflector
i thought i found the connector
its just a reflector
now , the signals we send , are deflected again
we 're so connected , but are we even friends
we fell in love , when i was nineteen
and now we 're staring at a screen
entre la nuit , la nuit et l'aurore
entre le royaume , des vivants et des morts
if this is heaven , i need something more
just a place to be alone , its in my heart
i thought i found a way to enter
its just a reflector
i thought i found the connector
its just a reflector
its just a reflector
its just a reflector
its just a reflector
its just a reflector
its just a reflector
its just a reflector
its just a reflector
just a reflection of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection of
reflection
i see you on the other side , we all got things to hide
our song it skips , on little silver disks
our love is plastic , they break it to bits
i want to break free , but will they break me ?
down down down do n't mess around
i thought i found a way to enter
its just a reflector
i thought i found the connector
its just a reflector , its just a reflector
its just a reflector
its just a reflector
its just a reflector
thought you were praying to the resurrector
turns out it was just a reflector

what 's been happening in your world ?
what have you been up to ?
i heard that you fell in love , or near enough
i got ta tell you the truth
i wan na grab both your shoulders and shake , baby
snap out of it
i get the feeling i left it too late , but baby
snap out of it
if that watch do n't continue to swing
or the fat lady fancies having a sing
i 'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it
forever is n't for everyone
is forever for you ?
it sounds like settling down or giving up
but it do n't sound much like you , girl

take it off
take it in
take off all the thoughts of what we 've been
take a look
hesitate
take a picture you could never recreate
write a song
make a note
for the lump that sits inside your throat
change the locks , change the scene
change it all but ca n't change what we 've been
ohhh ohhh
your trojan 's in my head
ohhh ohhh
your trojan 's in my head
it 's ok , if it 's gone
the thoughts that you had that it was the one
and oh what is left ?
for all those times is that what you get ?
oh ... .. regardless
the walls get painted anyway
oh you 're guarding
the gates , but it all got away
ohhh ohhh
your trojan 's in my head
ohhh ohhh
your trojan 's in my head
take it off
take it in
take off all the thoughts of what we 've been

change the locks , change the scene
change it all but ca n't change what we 've been
song over
never been for anything
never chained but never free
i lied to heal the broken love
with all that it could
live the life so endlessly
saw beyond what others see
i tried to heal your broken heart
with all that i could
will you stay
will you stay away forever ?
how do i live without the ones i love ?
time still turns the pages of the book , it 's burnt
facing times always on my mind
i have so much to say but you 're so far away
means a war of futures hold
foolish lies of grown and old
and seems we 're so invincible
the truth is so cold
a final song , a last request
a perfect chapter laid to rest
now and then i try to find
the place in my mind
where you can stay ?
you can stay awake forever !
how do i live without the ones i love ?
time still turns the pages of the book , it 's burnt
facing times always on my mind
i have so much to say but you 're so far away
sleep tight
i 'm not on pray
the ones that we love are here with me
lay away
a place for me
'cause as soon as i 'm done
i 'll be on my way
to live eternally
how do i live without the ones i love ?
time still turns the pages of the book , it 's burnt
facing times always on my mind
and the light you let remains
but it so hard to stay
and i have so much to say and you 're so far away
i love you
you were ready
the pain stroke in dark spines
but i see you
an it lets me
your pain is gone on hands of time
so far away - and i need you to know -
so far away - and i need you to need you to know -

when all of your flaws and all of my flaws are laid one by one
wonderful part of the mess we made
we pick ourselves undone
all of your flaws and all of my flaws , they lie there hand in hand
ones we 've inherited ones that we learn
they pass from man to man
there 's a hole in my soul
i ca n't fill it i ca n't fill it
and there 's a hole in my soul
can you fill it ? can you fill it ?
you have always worn you flaws upon your sleeve
and i have always buried them deep beneath the ground
dig them out
let 's finish what we started
dig them out
so nothing 's left untouched
all of your flaws and all of my flaws , they may have been exude
we 'll see that we need them to be who we are
without them we 'd be doomed
there 's a hole in my soul
i ca n't fill it i ca n't fill it
and there 's a hole in my soul
can you fill it ? can you fill it ?
you have always worn you flaws upon your sleeve

when all of your flaws and all of my flaws are counted x2

song over
walking out in to the dark ,
lead by a beating heart
all the people of the town
in matters of the heart
the night was all you had
you ran into the night from all you had
found yourself a path upon the ground
ran into the night you ca n't be found
this is your heart
can you feel it ? can you feel it ?
pumps through your veins
can you feel it ? can you feel it ?
summer evening breeze is blue
led by a beating heart
what a year and what a night
pull out your beating heart
the night was all you had
you ran into the night from all you had
found yourself a path upon the ground
ran into the night you ca n't be found
this is your heart
can you feel it ? can you feel it ?
pumps through your veins
can you feel it ? can you feel it ?
if you had your gun
would you shoot it at the sky ?
why ? to see where it would fall
oh will you come down at all ?
if you had your gun
would you shoot it at the sky ?
why ? to see where your bullet would fall
oh will you come down at all ?
this is your heart
can you feel it ? can you feel it ?
pumps through your veins

this is your racing heart
can you feel it ? can you feel it ?
pumps through your veins
can you feel it ? can you feel it ?

song over
i was left to my own devices
many days fell away with nothing to show
and the walls kept tumbling down
in the city that we loved
great clouds roll over the hills
bringing darkness from above
but if you close your eyes ,
does it almost feel like
nothing changed at all ?
and if you close your eyes ,
does it almost feel like
you 've been here before ?
how am i gon na be an optimist about this ?
how am i gon na be an optimist about this ?
we were caught up and lost in all of our vices
in your pose as the dust settles around us
and the walls kept tumbling down
in the city that we loved
great clouds roll over the hills
bringing darkness from above
but if you close your eyes ,
does it almost feel like
nothing changed at all ?
and if you close your eyes ,
does it almost feel like
you 've been here before ?
how am i gon na be an optimist about this ?
how am i gon na be an optimist about this ?
oh where do we begin ?
the rubble or our sins ?
oh where do we begin ?
the rubble or our sins ?
and the walls kept tumbling down
in the city that we loved
great clouds roll over the hills
bringing darkness from above
but if you close your eyes ,
does it almost feel like
nothing changed at all ?
and if you close your eyes ,
does it almost feel like
you 've been here before ?
how am i gon na be an optimist about this ?
how am i gon na be an optimist about this ?
but if you close your eyes ,

song over
things we lost to the flame
things we 'll never see again
all that we 've amassed
sits before us , shattered into ash
these are the things , the things we lost
the things we lost in the fire fire fire
these are the things , the things we lost
the things we lost in the fire fire fire
we sat and made a list
of all the things that we have
down the backs of table tops
ticket stubs and your diaries
i read them all one day
when loneliness came and you were away
oh they told me nothing new ,
but i love to read the words you used
these are the things , the things we lost
the things we lost in the fire fire fire
these are the things , the things we lost
the things we lost in the fire fire fire
i was the match and you were the rock
maybe we started this fire
we sat apart and watched
all we had burned on the pyre
-you said- we were born with nothing
and we sure as hell have nothing now
-you said- we were born with nothing
and we sure as hell have nothing now
these are the things , the things we lost
the things we lost in the fire fire fire
these are the things , the things we lost
the things we lost in the fire fire fire
flames they licked the walls
tenderly they turned to dust all that i adore
song over
so this is where we are
it 's not where we had wanted to be
if half the world 's gone mad
the other half just do n't care , you see
you do n't want to xxxx with us
british to the very last
when it feels like the world 's gone mad
and there 's nothing you can do about it
no there 's nothing you can do about it
when it feels like the world 's gone mad
and there 's nothing you can do about it
no there 's nothing you can do about it
so tell me what 's the news
and what is it you want me to see
we 're lying to ourselves
and dancing by the light of the screen
you do n't want to xxxx with us
british to the very last
when it feels like the world 's gone mad
and there 's nothing you can do about it
no there 's nothing you can do about it
when it feels like the world 's gone mad
and there 's nothing you can do about it
no there 's nothing you can do about it
another man holding a microphone
trying to say something at all
or finding himself on an empty road
trying to choose which way to go
so , you wan na make some money ?
you wan na make some money
so , you wan na be somebody ?
you wan na make some money
when it feels like the world 's gone mad
and there 's nothing you can do about it
no there 's nothing you can do about it
when it feels like the world 's gone mad
and there 's nothing you can do about it
no there 's nothing you can do about it
song over
we know full well there 's just time
so is it wrong to dance this line
if your heart was full of love , could you give it up ?
'coz what about , what about angels
they will come ; they will go make us special
do n't give me up .
do n't give me up .
how unfair it 's just our luck
found something real that 's out of touch .
but if you searched the whole wide world .
would you dare to let it go ?
'coz what about , what about angels
they will come ; they will go make us special
do n't give me up .
do n't give me up .
'coz what about , what about angels
they will come ; they will go make us special
it 's not about not about angels

i do n't wan na be another wave in the ocean
i am a rock , not just another grain of sand -that 's right-
i wan na be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
i ai n't a soldier but i 'm here to take a stand because we can
she 's in the kitchen starin ' out the window
so tired of livin ' life in black and white
right now she 's missin ' those technicolour kisses
when he turns down the lights
but lately feelin ' like a broken promise
in the mirror starin ' down his doubt
there 's only one thing in this world that he 'd know
he said forever and he 'll never let her down
i do n't wan na be another wave in the ocean
i am a rock , not just another grain of sand -that 's right-
i wan na be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
i ai n't a soldier but i 'm here to take a stand because we can
eatin ' takeout on a coffee table
paper dishes , pour a glass of wine
turn down the sound and move a little closer
and for the moment everything is alright
i do n't wan na be another wave in the ocean
i am a rock , not just another grain of sand -that 's right-
i wan na be the one you run to when you need a shoulder
i ai n't a soldier but i 'm here to take a stand because we can
because we can , our love can move a mountain
we can , if you believe in we
we can , just wrap your arms around me
we can , we can
i do n't wan na be another wave in the ocean
i am a rock , not just another grain of sand -that 's right-
i wan na be the one you run to when you need a shoulder

now the dark begins to rise
save your breath , it 's far from over
leave the lost and dead behind
now 's your chance to run for cover
i do n't wan na change the world
i just wan na leave it colder
light the fuse and burn it up
take the path that leads to nowhere
all is lost again
but i 'm not giving in
i will not bow
i will not break
i will shut the world away
i will not fall
i will not fade
i will take your breath away
i will not bow
i will not break
i will shut the world away
i will not fall
i will not fade
i will take your breath away
and i 'll survive , paranoid
i have lost the will to change
and i 'm not proud , cold-blooded fate
i will shut the world away
i will not bow
i will not break
i will shut the world away
i will not fall
i will not fade
i will take your breath away
and i 'll survive , paranoid
i have lost the will to change

can you hear the silence ?
can you see the dark ?
can you fix the broken ?
can you feel , can you feel my heart ?
can you help the hopeless ?
well , i 'm begging on my knees
can you save my busted soul ?
will you wait for me ?
i 'm sorry brothers , so sorry lover
forgive me father , i love you mother
can you hear the silence ?

i 'm scared to get close and i hate being alone
i long for that feeling to not feel at all

i ca n't drown my demons , they know how to swim
can you hear the silence ?
can you see the dark ?
can you fix the broken ?
can you feel , can you feel my heart ?

what does n't kill you
makes you wish you were dead
got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
and i ca n't take
one more moment of this silence
the loneliness is haunting me
and the weight of the worlds getting harder to hold up
it comes in waves
i close my eyes
hold my breath
and let it bury me
i 'm not ok
and it 's not all right
wo n't you drag the lake
and bring me home again
who will fix me now ?
dive in when i 'm down ?
save me from myself
do n't let me drown
who will make me fight ?
drag me out alive ?
save me from myself
do n't let me drown
what does n't destroy you
leaves you broken instead
got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
and i ca n't take
one more moment of this silence
the loneliness is haunting me
and the weight of the worlds getting harder to hold up
it comes in waves
i close my eyes
hold my breath

after your faith has let you down
i know you 'll want to run around
and follow the crowd into the night
but after the disco all of the shine just faded away
oh oh oh oh , do what you want , do what you will
do n't tell me it 's not our time
cause i 'm waiting here much too long and
do n't assume , that i need your
love . the chill of night has got you dancing away and i 'm
not the dreamer , or the dream you 're
out there looking for
how did i get in this winding maze of love ?
and there 's something wrong and it 's sending you
round and round til we go nowhere
i see the ashes on the ground
i know the world is burning down
and under the cold and empty moon

song over
i was walking down the street ,
when out the corner of my eye
i saw a pretty little thing approaching me .
she said `` i 've never seen a man
who looks so all alone ,
could you use a little company ?
if you pay the right price
your evening will be nice ,
and you can go and send me on my way . ''
i said `` you 're such a sweet young thing
why you do this to yourself ? ''
she looked at me and this is what she said ,
`` oh , there ai n't no rest for the wicked ,
money do n't grow on trees .
i got bills to pay ,
i got mouths to feed ,
there ai n't nothing in this world for free .
i know i ca n't slow down ,
i ca n't hold back ,
though you know , i wish i could .
no there ai n't no rest for the wicked ,
until we close our eyes for good '' .
song over
tonight i ’ ll have a look
and try to find my face again
buried beneath this house
my spirit screams and dies again
out back a monster wears a
cloak of persian leather
behind the tv screen
i 've fallen to my knees
i said you 've got me where you want me
again i ca n't turn away
i 'm hanging by a thread and im feeling like a fool
i 'm stuck here in between the shadows of my yesterday
i want to get away
i need to get away
blanket of silence
makes me want to sink my teeth in deep
burn all the evidence
a fabricated disbelief
pull back the curtains take a look into your eyes
my tongue has now become a platform for your lies i said
you 've got me where you want me
again i ca n't turn away
i 'm hanging by a thread and im feeling like a fool
i 'm stuck here in between the shadows of my yesterday
i want to get away
i need to get away
now you know
yeah , you got my back against the wall
oh gosh , i aint got no other place to hide
chained down , like a sitting duck
just waiting for the fall
you know , yeah you got my back against the wall
deep in the jungle
camouflaged by all the fallen leaves
a hand holds up the sky
while shamefully i make my plea
the alters callin ’
but my legs won ’ t seem to stand
guess i 'm a coward
scared to face the man i am i said
you 've got me where you want me
again i ca n't turn away
i 'm hanging by a thread and im feeling like a fool
i 'm stuck here right between the shadows of my yesterday
i want to get away
i need to get away
now you know
yeah , you got my back against the wall
oh gosh , i aint got no other place to hide
chained down , like a sitting duck
just waiting for the fall
you know , yeah you got my back against the wall
now you know
yeah , you got my back against the wall
oh gosh , i aint got no other place to hide
chained down , like a sitting duck
just waiting for the fall
you know , yeah you got my back against the wall
song over
did you stand there all alone
oh i can not explain what 's going down
i can see you standing next to me
in and out somewhere else right now
you sigh look away
i can see it clear as day
close your eyes so afraid
hide behind that baby face
you can drive all night
looking for the answers in the pouring rain
you wan na find peace of mind
looking for the answer
funny how it seems like yesterday
as i recall you were looking out of place
gathered up your things and slipped away
no time at all i followed you into the hall
cigarette daydream
you were only seventeen
soft speak with a mean streak
nearly brought me to my knees
you can drive all night
looking for the answers in the pouring rain
you wan na find peace of mind
looking for the answer
if we could find a reason , a reason to change
looking for the answer
if you can find a reason , a reason to say
standing in the pouring rain
you can drive all night
looking for the answers in the pouring rain
you wan na find peace of mind
looking for the answer
if we could find a reason , a reason to change
looking for the answer

time shakes , found you at the water
at first you were my father , now i love you like a brother

things are n't always what they seem to be
come on , come on , come on
do you understand the things that you would see here
come on , come on , come on
do you understand the things that you 've been dreaming
come a little closer than you seem
heartbreaks , that have me rest upon your shoulder
will you buy my ... - ? -
so now i know i found you there
uuuh , wan na see if you can change it ,
change it , still not know , i seem good

song over
shake me down
not alot of
people left around
who know 's now
softly laying on
the ground oh-oohh
not alot of people left
around oh-oohh oh-oohh
in my life i have seen
people walking to the seat
just to find memory
plagued my constant misery
their eyes cast down
fixed upon the ground
their eyes cast down
i 'll keep my eyes
fixed on the sun
shake me down
cut my hair on
a silver cloud
broken sound
softly laying on the
ground oh-oohh
not alot of people left
around oh-oohh oh-oohh
in my past bitter sweet
found no love between the sheets
take the blood broken dreams
lonely times indeed
with eyes cast down
fixed upon the ground
with eyes cast down
i 'll keep my eyes
fixed on the sun
turn back no it 's
time for me to let go
way down had to
find a place to lay low
lamp shade turning right into a lamp post
walk around the corner
never saw it coming still
i try to make a move
it almost stopped me from belief
i do n't wan na know the future
i 'm like rolling thunder
even on a cloudy day
even on a cloudy day
even on a cloudy day
even on a cloudy day
even on a cloudy day
even on a cloudy day
even on a cloudy day
i 'll keep my eyes fixed on the i 'll keep my eyes fixed on the
i 'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
shake me down
not a lot of people
left around

song over
it 's not time to make a change , just relax and take it easy
you 're still young that 's your fault
there 's so much you have to know
find a girl , settle down , if you want to , you can marry
look at me , i am old , but i 'm happy
i was once like you are now , and i know that its not easy
to be calm , when you 've found something going on
but take your time , think a lot , why think of everything you 've got
for you will still be here tomorrow , but your dreams may not
how can i try to explain ? when i do he turns away again
it 's always been the same , same old story
from the moment i could talk i was ordered to listen
now there 's a way and i know i have to go away
and i know i have to go
it 's not time to make a change , just relax and take it easy
you 're still young that 's your fault
there 's so much you have to know
find a girl , settle down , if you want to , you can marry
look at me , i am old , but i 'm happy
all the times that i cried , keeping all the things i knew inside
it 's hard , but it 's harder to ignore it
if they were right , i 'd agree , but it 's them they know , not me
now there 's a way , and i know that i have to go away
i know i have to go
song over
deep down louisiana close to new orleans
way back up in the woods among the ever greens
there stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
where lived a country boy named johnny b. goode
who never ever learned to read or write so well
but he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell
go go go johnny go go go johnny go
go go johnny go
go go johnny go
go
johnny b. goode
he used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
oh , the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
people passing by they would stop and say
oh my that little country boy could play
go go go johnny go go go johnny go
go go johnny go
go go johnny go
go
johnny b. goode
his mother told him `` someday you will be a man ,
and you will be the leader of a big old band .
many people coming from miles around
to hear you play your music when the sun go down
maybe someday your name will be in lights
saying johnny b. goode tonight . ''
go go go johnny go go go johnny go
go go johnny go
go go johnny go

took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
i took a car downtown and took what they offered me
to set me free
i saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
i saw the lights go down and they 're standing in front of me
my scarecrow dreams
when they smashed my heart into smithereens
i 'll be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
be a cartoon heart
light a fire , from a spark
light a fire , a flame in my heart
we 'll run wild
we 'll be glowing in the dark
all the boys , all the girls
all the madness in the world
all the boys , all the girls
all the madness that occurs
all the highs , all the lows
as the room is spinning , oh
we 'll run wild oh
we 'll start glowing in the dark
it was all an innocent riot
we 'll be glowing in the dark

christmas night , another fight
tears we cried a flood
got all kinds of poison in
poison in my blood
i took my feet
trying to right a wrong
just walk away
but i ca n't believe she 's gone
when you 're still waiting for the snow to fall
does n't really feel like christmas at all
up above candles on air flicker
oh they flicker and they float
but i 'm up here holding on
to all those chandeliers of hope
like some drunken elvis singing
i go singing out of tune
saying how i always loved you darling
and i always will
oh when you 're still waiting for the snow to fall
does n't really feel like christmas at all
still waiting for the snow to fall
it does n't really feel like christmas at all
those christmas lights
down where the sea and city meet
may all your troubles soon be gone
oh christmas lights keep shining on
those christmas lights
light up the street
maybe they 'll bring her back to me
then all my troubles will be gone

light up the fireworks in me

i shut the world outside until the lights come on
maybe the streets alight , maybe the trees are gone
i feel my heart start beating to my favourite song
and all the kids they dance , all the kids all night
until monday morning feels another life
i turn the music up
and heaven is in sight
i turn the music up , i got my records on
from underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
don ’ t want to see another generation drop
i ’ d rather be a comma than a full stop
maybe i ’ m in the black , maybe i ’ m on my knees
maybe i ’ m in the gap batween the two trapezes
but my heart is beating and my pulses start
cathedrals in my heart
and we saw oh this light i swear you , emerge blinking into
to tell me it ’ s alright
as we soar walls , every siren is a symphony
and every tear ’ s a waterfall
is a waterfall

so you can hurt , hurt me bad

when she was just a girl
she expected the world
but it flew away from her reach
so she ran away in her sleep
and dreamed of para-para-paradise
para-para-paradise
para-para-paradise
every time she closed her eyes
when she was just a girl
she expected the world
but it flew away from her reach
and the bullets catch in her teeth
life goes on and gets so heavy
the wheel breaks the butterfly
every tear a waterfall
in the night the stormy night she close her eyes
in the night the stormy night away she flies
and dream of para-para-paradise

nobody said it was easy ,
no one ever said it would be so hard .

i was just guessin ' at numbers and figures ,
pulling the puzzles apart .
questions of science , science and progress
do n't speak as loud as my heart .
and tell me you love me , come back and haunt me

i used to rule the world
seas would rise when i gave the word
now in the morning i sleep alone
sweep the streets i used to own
i used to roll the dice
feel the fear in my enemy 's eyes
listen as the crowd would sing :
`` now the old king is dead ! long live the king ! ''
one minute i held the key
next the walls were closed on me
and i discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror , my sword , and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i ca n't explain
once you go there was never , never an honest word
that was when i ruled the world
it was the wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in .
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people could n't believe what i 'd become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
oh who would ever want to be king ?
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror , my sword , and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i ca n't explain
i know saint peter will call my name ,
never an honest word
but that was when i ruled the world
- ohhhhh ohhh ohhh -
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror , my sword , and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field

i fear rivers over flowing .
i hear the voice of rage and ruin .
don t go around tonight ,

hope you got your things together .
hope you are quite prepared to die .

lyin ’ in the park
on a beautiful day
sun shine in the grass and the children play
siren ’ s passin ’
fire engine 's red
someone ’ s house is burning down on a day like this
the evening comes
and we ’ re hangin ’ out
on the front step
and a car goes by with the windows rolled down
and that war song is playin “ why can ’ t we be friends ? ”
someone 's screamin ’ and cryin ’ in the apartment upstairs
funny the way it is
and if you think about it
somebody ’ s goin ’ hungry
and someone else is eatin ’ out
funny the way it is
whether right or wrong
somebody ’ s heart is broken
and it becomes your favorite song
the way your mouth feels in your lover ’ s kiss
like a pretty bird on a breeze
or water to a fish
but a bomb blast brings the building crashin ’ to the floor
hear the laughter while the children play war
funny the way it is
and if you think about it
one kid walks 10 miles to school
while another ’ s droppin ’ out
funny the way it is
no matter right or wrong
on a soldier ’ s last breath
his baby ’ s being born
watch the water passin ’ under me
it must have been much harder
now the world is small
remember how it used to be
with mountains , and oceans , and winters , and rivers and
stars
watch the sky the jet-planes
so far out of my reach
is there someone up there lookin ’ down on me ?
boy chase a bird
so close but every time
he never catch her
but he can ’ t stop trying
funny the way it is
and if you think about it
one kid walks 10 miles to school
while another ’ s droppin ’ out
funny the way it is
no matter right or wrong
on a soldier ’ s last breath
his baby ’ s being born
funny the way it is
no matter right or wrong
somebody ’ s broken heart
and it becomes your favorite song

like the dolphins - like dolphins can swim
though nothing - nothing will keep us together
we can beat them forever and ever
oh we can be heroes just for one day
i - i will be king
and you - you will be queen
for nothing will drive them away
we can be heroes - just for one day
we can be honest - just for one day
i - i can remember - i remember -
standing by the wall - by the wall -
and the guards shot above our heads - over our heads -
and we kissed as though nothing would fall - nothing could fall -
and the shame was on the other side
oh we can beat them forever and ever
then we can be heroes just for one day
we can be heroes

we can be heroes just for one day

it 's a god-awful small affair , to the girl with the mousy hair
but her mother is yelling `` no , '' and her father as told her to go
but her friend is nowhere to be seen , as she walks through her sunken dream
to the seat with the clearest view , and she 's hooked to the silver screen
but the film is a saddening bore , for she 's lived it ten times or more
she could spit in the eyes of fools , as they ask her to focus on
sailors , fighting in the dance hall
oh man ! look at those cavemen go ,
it 's a freakest show , take a look at the
lawman , beating up the wrong guy
oh man ! wonder if he 'll ever know
he 's in the best selling show
is there life on mars ?
it 's on amerika 's tortured brow , mickey mouse has grown up a cow
now the workers have struck for fame , cause lennon 's on sale again
see the mice in their million hordes , from ibeza to the norfolk broads
rule brittania is out of bounds , to my mother , my dog and clowns
but the film is a saddening bore , cause i wrote it ten times before
it 's about to be writ again , as i ask you to focus on
sailors , fighting in the dance hall
oh man ! look at those cavemen go ,
it 's a freakest show , take a look at the
lawman , beating up the wrong guy
oh man ! wonder if he 'll ever know

now it 's time to leave the capsule if you dare
this is major tom to ground control

and i 'm floating in a most peculiar way
and the stars look very different today
for here am i sitting in a tin can
far above the world
planet earth is blue and there 's nothing i can do

i 'm feeling very still
and i think my spaceship knows which way to go
tell my wife i love her very much
she knows

hey that 's far out , so you heard him too-oo-oo

in flames of death 's eternal rain
we ride towards the fight
when the darkness is falling down
and the times are tough alright
the sound of evil laughter
falls around the world tonight
fighting hard , fighting on for the steel
through the wastelands evermore
the scattered souls will feel the hell
bodies wasted on the shores
on the blackest plains in hell 's domain
we watch them as they go
in fire and pain , now once again we know
so now we fly ever free ,
we 're free before the thunderstorm
on towards the wilderness
our quest carries on
far beyond the sundown , far beyond the moonlight
deep inside our hearts and all our souls
so far away we wait for the day
for the light source so wasted and gone
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days through the fire and the flames we carry on
as the red day is dawning
and the lightning cracks the sky
they will raise their hands to the heavens above
with resentment in their eyes
running back through the midmorning light
there 's a burning in my heart
we 're banished from a time in a fallen land
to a life beyond the stars
in your darkest dreams you still believe
our destiny this time
and endlessly we 'll all be free tonight
and on the wings of a dream so far beyond reality
all alone in desperation , now that time has come
lost inside you 'll never find , lost within my own mind
day after day this misery must go on
so far away we wait for the day
for the light source so wasted and gone
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days through the fire and the flames we carry on
now here we stand with their blood on our hands
we fought so hard now can we understand
i 'll break the seal of this curse if i possibly can
for freedom of every man
so far away we wait for the day
for the light source so wasted and gone
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days through the fire and the flames we carry on
song over
on a dark desert highway , cool wind in my hair
warm smell of colitas , rising up through the air
up ahead in the distance , i saw a shimmering light
my head grew heavy and my sight grew dim i had to stop for the night
there she stood in the doorway ; i heard the mission bell
and i was thinking to myself , `` this could be heaven or this could be hell ''
then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
there were voices down the corridor , i thought i heard them say ...
welcome to the hotel california
such a lovely place - such a lovely place - such a lovely face
plenty of room at the hotel california
any time of year - any time of year - you can find it here
her mind is tiffany-twisted , she got the mercedes bends
she got a lot of pretty , pretty boys she calls friends
how they dance in the courtyard , sweet summer sweat .
some dance to remember , some dance to forget
so i called up the captain , `` please bring me my wine ''
he said , `` we have n't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine ''
and still those voices are calling from far away ,
wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say ...
welcome to the hotel california
such a lovely place - such a lovely place - such a lovely face
they livin ' it up at the hotel california
what a nice surprise - what a nice surprise - bring your alibis
mirrors on the ceiling , the pink champagne on ice
and she said `` we are all just prisoners here , of our own device ''
and in the master 's chambers , they gathered for the feast
they stab it with their steely knives , but they just ca n't kill the beast
last thing i remember , i was running for the door
i had to find the passage back to the place i was before
`` relax , `` said the night man , `` we are programmed to receive .
you can check-out any time you like , but you can never leave ! ``

well , i 'm a runnin ' down the road , tryin ' to loosen my load ,
i 've got seven women on my mind .
four that wan na own me , two that wan na stone me ,
one says she 's a friend of mine .
take it easy , take it ea - sy ,
do n't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy .
lighten up while you still can , do n't even try to understand ,
just find a place to make your stand and take it easy .
well , i 'm a standin ' on a corner in winslow , arizona
and such a fine sight to see :
it 's a girl , my lord , in a flat bed ford
slowin ' down to take a look at me .
come on , ba - by , do n't say may - be .
i got ta know if your sweet love is gon na save me .
we may lose and we may win though we will never be here again .
so open up , i 'm climbin ' in , so take it easy .
well , i 'm a runnin ' down the road , tryin ' to loosen my load ,
got a world of trouble on my mind .
lookin ' for a lover who wo n't blow my cover ,

song over
i wan na be drunk when i wake up
on the right side of the wrong bed
what did n't kill me
it never made me stronger at all .
love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
so now i 'll maybe leave back there
i 'm sat here wishing i was sober
i know i 'll never hold you like i used to .
but our house gets cold when you cut the heating
without you to hold i 'll be freezing
ca n't rely on my heart to beat it
'cause you take part of it every evening
take words out of my mouth just from breathing
replace with phrases like when you 're leaving me .
should i , should i ?
maybe i 'll get drunk again
i 'll be drunk again
i 'll be drunk again
to feel a little love
all by myself
all by myself
all by myself
all by myself
i 'm just drunk again
i 'll be drunk again
i 'll be drunk again
to feel a little love
song over

and that i 'll fight my corner
maybe tonight i 'll call you

song over
keep watching over durin 's son
if this is to end in fire
then we shall all burn together
watch the flames climb high into the night
calling out father , stand by and we will
watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
and if we should die tonight
then we should all die together
raise a glass of wine for the last time
calling out father , prepare as we will
watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
desolation comes upon the sky
now i see fire , inside the mountain
i see fire , burning the trees
and i see fire , hollowing souls
i see fire , blood in the breeze
oh , should my people fall
then surely i 'll do the same
confined in mountain halls
we got too close to the flame
calling out father hold fast and we will
watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
desolation comes upon the sky
now i see fire , inside the mountain
i see fire , burning the trees
and i see fire , hollowing souls
i see fire , blood in the breeze
and i hope that you 'll remember me
and if the night is burning
i will cover my eyes
for if the dark returns then
my brothers will die
and as the sky 's falling down
it crashed into this lonely town
and with that shadow upon the ground
i hear my people screaming out
now i see fire , inside the mountain
i see fire , burning the trees
and i see fire , hollowing souls
i see fire , blood in the breeze
i see fire , oh you know i saw a city burning -fire-
i see fire , feel the heat upon my skin -fire-
and i see fire , oooooo -fire-
and i see fire burn auburn on the mountain side

and your heart 's against my chest , your lips pressed to my neck .
and i 'm falling for your eyes , but they do n't know me yet .
and with this feeling i 'll forget , i 'm in love now

song over
i 'm gon na pick up the pieces ,
and build a lego house
when things go wrong we can knock it down
my three words have two meanings ,
there 's one thing on my mind
it 's all for you
and it 's dark in a cold december , but i 've got ya to keep me warm
and if you 're broken i will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm
that 's raging on
i 'm out of touch , i 'm out of love
i 'll pick you up when you 're getting down
and out of all these things i 've done i think i love you better now
i 'm out of sight , i 'm out of mind
i 'll do it all for you in time
and out of all these things i 've done i think i love you better now
i 'm gon na paint you by numbers
and colour you in
if things go right we can frame it , and put you on a wall
and it 's so hard to say it but i 've been here before
and i 'll surrender up my heart
and swap it for yours
i 'm out of touch , i 'm out of love
i 'll pick you up when you 're getting down
and out of all these things i 've done i think i love you better now
i 'm out of sight , i 'm out of mind
i 'll do it all for you in time
and out of all these things i 've done i think i love you better now
do n't hold me down
i think my braces are breaking and it 's more than i can take
and if you 're broken i will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm
that 's raging on
i 'm out of touch , i 'm out of love
i 'll pick you up when you 're getting down
and out of all these things i 've done i think i love you better now
i 'm out of touch , i 'm out of love
i 'll pick you up when you 're getting down
and out of all these things i 've done i think i love you better now
song over
i 'm falling harder than i 've ever felt before
i 'm falling faster while hoping i 'll land in your arms
cause all my time is spent here
longing to belong to you
i dream of circles perfect eyes within your face
my hearts an open wound that only you ’ d replace
and though the moon is rising
can ’ t put your picture down
love can be frightening when you fall
and when the time is right i hope that you ’ ll respond
like when the wind gets tired the ocean becomes calm
i may be dreaming but i ’ m longing to belong to you
song over
i had a way then losing it all on my own
i had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown
and i 'm not sleeping now the dark is too hard to beat
and i 'm not keeping now the strength i need to push me
you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
you shine it when i 'm alone
and so i tell myself that i 'll be strong
and dreaming when they 're gone
'cause they 're calling , calling , calling me home
calling , calling , calling home
you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
you shine it when i 'm alone
noises , i play within my head
touch my own skin and hope that i 'm still breathing
and i think back to when my brother and my sister slept
in an unlocked place the only time i feel safe
you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
you shine it when i 'm alone
and so i tell myself that i 'll be strong
and dreaming when they 're gone
'cause they 're calling , calling , calling me home
calling , calling , calling home
you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
you shine it when i 'm alone
home
you show the lights that stop me turn to stone
you shine it when i 'm alone
and so i tell myself that i 'll be strong
and dreaming when they 're gone
'cause they 're calling , calling , calling me home

when are you going to land
i should have stayed on the farm , should have
listened to my old man

i did n't sign up with you
i 'm not a present for your friends to open
this boy 's too young to be singing the
blu-u-ues ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
so goodbye , yellow brick road
where the dogs of society howl
you ca n't plant me in your penthouse
i 'm going back to my plow
back to the howling old owl in the woods
hunting the horny back toad
oh i 've finally decided my future lies
beyond the yellow brick
ro-o-oad ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh ah
what do you think you 'll do then
i bet that 'll shoot down the plane
it 'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
to set you on your feet again
maybe you 'll get a replacement
there 's plenty like me to be found
mongrels who ai n't got a penny
sniffing for tidbits like you on the
gro-o-ound ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
so goodbye , yellow brick road
where the dogs of society howl
you ca n't plant me in your penthouse

it 's lonely out in space
on such a timeless flight as this
and i think it 's gon na be a long long time

i 'm not the man they think i am at home
oh no , no , no , i 'm a rocket man
rocket man , burnin ' out his fuse up here alone -2x-
mars ai n't the kinda place to raise your kids
in fact it 's cold as hell
and there 's no one there to raise them if you did
and all this science , i do n't understand

blue jean baby , l.a. lady ,
seamstress for the band
pretty eyed , pirate smile ,
you 'll marry a music man
ballerina , you must have seen her
dancing in the sand
and now she 's in me , always with me ,
tiny dancer in my hand
jesus freaks , out in the street ,
handing tickets out for god
turning back , she just laughs
the boulevard is not that bad
piano man , he makes his stand
in the auditorium
looking on , she sings the songs
the words she knows , the tune she hums
but oh how , it feels so real ,
lying here , with no one near
only you , and you can hear me
when i say softly , slowly
hold me closer tiny dancer
count the headlights on the highway
lay me down in sheets of linen
you had a busy day today
hold me closer tiny dancer
count the headlights on the highway
lay me down in sheets of linen
you had a busy day today -x3-

this is the road to ruin
and we 're starting at the end

they love it more when it 's broke in
do you wan na feel beautiful , do you wan na

you and i were , you and i were fire , fire , fireworks
that went off too soon
and i miss you in the june gloom too
it was the fourth of july
you and i were , you and i were fire , fire , fireworks
i said i ’ d never miss you , but i guess you never know
i ’ ll be as honest as you ’ ll let me
i miss your early morning company , if you get me
you are my favorite `` what if ''
you are my best `` i ’ ll never know '' , and
i ’ m staring to forget
just what summer ever meant to you
what did it ever mean to you ?
i ’ m sorry i didn ’ t mean any of it
i just got too lonely , lonely , oh-oh
in between being young and being right
you were my versailles at night
it was the fourth of july
you and i were , you and i were fire , fire , fireworks
that went off too soon
and i miss you in the june gloom too
it was the fourth of july
you and i were , you and i were fire , fire , fireworks
i said i ’ d never miss you , but i guess you never know
my nine to five is cutting open old scars
again and again till i ’ m stuck in your head
had my doubts , but i let them out , you 're the drought
and i ’ m the holy water you have been without
and all my thoughts of you
they could heat or cool the room
and no , don ’ t tell me you cried
honey , you don ’ t have to lie
i ’ m sorry i didn ’ t mean any of it

i just pinch myself
no longer comatose
i woke up , no luck
i woke up , no luck
and when your stitch comes loose
i wan na sleep on every piece of fuzz
and stuffing that comes out of you , you
i took too many hits off this memory
i need to come down
an-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
so hold me tight
hold me tight , or do n't
oh n-n-no , no this is n't how our story ends
so hold me tight

realized i ca n't not be with you
or be just your friend
i love you to death
but i just ca n't , i just ca n't pretend
we were n't lovers first
confidants but never friends
were we ever friends ?
and when your stitch comes loose
i wan na sleep on every piece of fuzz
and stuffing that comes out of you , you
i took too many hits off this memory
i need to come down
an-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
so hold me tight
hold me tight , or do n't
oh n-n-no , no this is n't how our story ends
so hold me tight
hold me tight , or do n't
hold me tight , or do n't
'cause i 'm past the limits
the distance between us
it sharpens me like a knife
past the limits
the distance between us
it sharpens me like a knife
an-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
so hold me tight
hold me tight , or do n't
i 'm pretty sure that this is n't how our story ends
so hold me tight
hold me tight , or do n't
song over
they say we are what we are , but we don ’ t have to be
i ’ m bad behavior but i do it in the best way
i ’ ll be the watcher of the eternal flame
i ’ ll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams
i am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass . -glass , glass-
i ’ ll try to picture me without you but i can ’ t
'cause we could be immortals , immortals
just not for long , for long
live with me forever now , pull the blackout curtains down
just not for long , for long
we could be immor-immortals , immor-tals , immor-immortals , immor-tals
sometimes the only payoff for having any faith
is when it ’ s tested again and again everyday
i ’ m still comparing your past to my future
it might be you 're wound , but they ’ re my sutures
i am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass . -glass , glass-
i ’ ll try to picture me without you but i can ’ t
'cause we could be immortals , immortals
just not for long , for long
live with me forever now , pull the blackout curtains down
just not for long , for long
we could be immor-immortals , immor-tals , immor-immortals , immor-tals
and live with me forever now , pull the blackout curtains down
'cause we could be immortals , immortals
just not for long , for long
live with me forever now , pull the blackout curtains down
just not for long , for long
we could be immor-immortals , immor-tals , immor-immortals , immor-tals
'cause we could be immortals , immortals
just not for long , for long

song over
i got those jet pack blues
just like judy
the kind that makes june feel like september
i ’ m the last one that you ’ ll ever remember
and i ’ m trying to find that peace of mind
behind these two white highway lines
when the city goes silent
the ringing in my ears gets violent
she ’ s in a long black coat tonight
waiting for me in the downpour outside
she ’ s singing “ baby come home ” in a melody of tears
while the rhythm of the rain keeps time
and i remember ” baby , come home ”
i remember ” baby , come home ”
i remember ” baby , come home ”
i remember ” baby , come home ”
did you ever love her ? do you know ?
or did you never want to be alone ?
and she was singing “ baby , come home ”
`` baby , come home ''
i ’ ve got those jet pack blues
fight off the light tonight and just stay with me
honey , don ’ t you leave
don ’ t you remember how we used to split a drink ?
it never mattered what it was
i think our hands were just that close
the sweetness never lasted , no
she ’ s in a long black coat tonight
waiting for me in the downpour outside
she ’ s singing “ baby come home ” in a melody of tears
while the rhythm of the rain keeps time
and i remember ” baby , come home ”
i remember ” baby , come home ”
i remember ” baby , come home ”
i remember ” baby , come home ”
did you ever love her ? do you know ?
or did you never want to be alone ?
and she was singing “ baby , come home ”
`` baby , come home ''
she ’ s in a long black coat tonight
waiting for me in the downpour outside
she ’ s singing “ baby come home ” in a melody of tears
while the rhythm of the rain keeps time
and i remember ” baby , come home ”
i remember ” baby , come home ”
i remember ” baby , come home ”
i remember ” baby , come home ”
did you ever love her ? do you know ?
or did you never want to be alone ?
and she was singing “ baby , come home ”
`` baby , come home ''

i think i got too many memories getting in the way of me
i 'm about to go tonya harding on the whole world 's knee
and i 'm stuck , night vision so stuck night vision
but i come to life , come to life
some princes do n't become kings
even at the best times i 'm out of my mind
you only get what you grieve
are you smelling that xxxx ?
are you smelling that xxxx ? -nc- eau de résistance
the only thing that 's ever stopping me is me , hey
the only thing that 's ever stopping me is me , hey
i testify if i die in my sleep
then know that my life was just a killer dream , yeah
seems like the whole damn world went and lost its mind
and all my childhood heroes have fallen off or died
fake tears , we are living fake tears
but the alcohol never lies , never lies
some princes do n't become kings
even at the best times i 'm out of my mind
you only get what you grieve
are you smelling that xxxx ?

song over
stuck in the jet wash
bad trip i could n't get off
and maybe i bit off more than i could chew
and overhead of the aqua blue
fall to your knees bring on the rapture
blessed be the boys time ca n't capture
on film or between the sheets
i always fall from your window to the pitch black streets
and with the black banners raised
as the crooked smiles fade
former heroes who quit too late
just wan na fill up the trophy case again
and in the end , i 'd do it all again
i think you 're my best friend
do n't you know that the kids are n't all , kids are n't alright
i 'll be yours , when it rains it pours
stay thirsty i 'll be fine
do n't you know that the kids are n't all , kids are n't alright
i 'm not passive but aggressive
take note , it 's not impressive
empty your sadness like you 're dumping your purse
and it 's our time now if you want to to be
more the war like the carnival bears set free
and your love is anemic and i ca n't believe
that you could n't see it coming from me
and i still feel that rush in my veins
it twists my head just a bit too thin
all those people in those old photographs i 've seen are dead
and in the end , i 'd do it all again
i think you 're my best friend
do n't you know that the kids are n't all , kids are n't alright
i 'll be yours , when it rains it pours
stay thirsty i 'll be fine
do n't you know that the kids are n't all , kids are n't alright
and sometimes i just want to sit around , and gaze at my shoes yeah
and let your dirty sadness fill me up , just like a balloon
and in the end , i 'd do it all again
i think you 're my best friend
do n't you know that the kids are n't all , kids are n't alright
i 'll be yours , when it rains it pours
stay thirsty i 'll be fine
do n't you know that the kids are n't all , kids are n't alright

but not as much as i do

you are a brick tied to me that 's dragging me down
strike a match and i 'll burn you to the ground
we are the jack-o-lanterns in july
here , here comes this rising tide
put on your war paint
cross walks and crossed hearts and hope-to-dies
so we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
one maniac at a time we will take it back
you know time crawls on when you 're waiting for the song to
start so dance along to the beat of your heart
hey young blood
does n't it feel
like our time is running out
i 'm gon na change you like a remix
then i 'll raise you like a phoenix
you 're wearing our vintage misery
no , i think it looked a little better on me
i 'm gon na change you like a remix
then i 'll raise you like a phoenix
bring home the boys and scrap scrap metal the tanks
get hitched and make a career out of robbing banks
because the world is just a teller and
`` you broke our spirit , '' says the note we pass
so we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
one maniac at a time we will take it back

i love the way that your heart breaks
with every injustice and deadly fate
praying it all be new
and living like it all depends on you
here you are down on your knees again
trying to find air to breathe again
only surrender will help you now
i love you please see and believe again
i love that you 're never satisfied
with face value wisdom and happy lies
you take what they say and go back and cry
you 're so close to me that you nearly died
here you are down on your knees again
trying to find air to breathe again
only surrender will help you now
i love you please see and believe again
they do n't have to understand you , be still
wait and know i understand you , be still . be still
here you are down on your knees again
trying to find air to breathe again
only surrender will help you now
the floodgates are breaking and pouring out
here you are down on your knees
trying to find air to breathe
right where i want you to be again
i love you please see and believe again
here you are down on your knees again
trying to find air to breathe again

all the other kids with the pumped up kicks
you 'd better run , better run
faster than my bullet
daddy works a long day
he 'll be coming home late , he 's coming home late
and he 's bringing me a surprise
cos ' dinner 's in the kitchen and it 's packed in ice
i 've waited for a long time
the slight of my hand is now a quick pull trigger
i reason with my cigarette
and say your hair 's on fire you must have lost your wits , yeah
all the other kids with the pumped up kicks
you 'd better run , better run
outrun my gun
all the other kids with the pumped up kicks
you 'd better run , better run
faster than my bullet
all the other kids with the pumped up kicks
you 'd better run , better run
outrun my gun
all the other kids with the pumped up kicks
you 'd better run , better run
faster than my bullet
- run run run -
- whistle -
all the other kids with the pumped up kicks
you 'd better run , better run
outrun my gun
all the other kids with the pumped up kicks
you 'd better run , better run
faster than my bullet
all the other kids with the pumped up kicks
you 'd better run , better run
outrun my gun
all the other kids with the pumped up kicks
you 'd better run , better run

song over
blacking in and out in a strange flat in east london
somebody i do n't really know just gave me something
to help settle me down and to stop me from always thinking about you
and you know you 're life is heading in a questionable direction
when you 're up for days with strangers and you ca n't remember anything
except the way you sounded when you told me you did n't know what i should do
it 's a long road up to recovery from here
a long way back to the light
it 's a long road up to recovery from here
a long way to making it right
and so i wake up in the morning just like every other day
and just like every boring blues song i get swallowed by the pain
so i fumble for your figure in the darkness just to make it go away
but you 're not lying there any longer and i know that that 's my fault
so i 've been pounding on the floor and i 've been crawling up the walls
and i 've been dipping in my darkness for serotonin
boosters , cider and some kind of smelling salts
it 's a long road up to recovery from here
a long way back to the light
it 's a long road up to recovery from here
a long way to making it right
so on the first night we met , you said well darling let 's make a deal
if anybody ever asks us , let 's just tell them that we met in jail
and that 's the story that i 'm sticking to like a southern facing compass
but tonight i need to hear some truth if i 'm ever getting through this
yeah , you once sent me a letter that said if you 're lost at sea
close your eyes and catch the tide my dear and only think of me
well , darling now i 'm was sinking i 'm as lost as lost can be
and i was hoping you could drag me up from down here towards my recovery
if you could just give me a sign , just a subtle little glimmer
some suggestion that you 'd have me if i could only make me better
then i would stand a little stronger as i walk a little taller all the time
because i know you are a cynic but i think i can convince you
yeah , cause broken people can get better if they really want to
or at least that 's what i have to tell myself if i am hoping to survive
it 's a long road up to recovery from here
a long way back to the light
it 's a long road up to recovery from here
a long way to making it right
so , darling , sweet lover , wo n't you help me to recover
darling , sweet lover , wo n't you help me to recover
darling , sweet lover , wo n't you help me to recover
darling , sweet lover , one day this will all be over
song over
the garden was blessed by the gods of me and you
we headed west for to find ourselves some truth
oh , what you waiting for , now what you waiting for
we counted all our reasons , excuses that we made
we found ourselves some treasure and threw it all away
oh , what you waiting for , now what you waiting for
oh , what you waiting for , now what you waiting for
when i dance alone and the sun 's bleeding down , blame it on me
when i lose control and the veil 's overused , blame it on me
what you waiting for , now what you waiting for
caught in the tide of blossom , caught in the carnival
your confidence forgotten , i see the gypsies run
oh , what you waiting for , now what you waiting for
oh , what you waiting for , now what you waiting for
when i dance alone and the sun 's bleeding down , blame it on me
when i lose control and the veil 's overused , blame it on me
oh , what you waiting for , now what you waiting for
oh , what you waiting for , now what you waiting for
when i dance alone and the sun 's bleeding down , blame it on me
when i lose control and the veil 's overused , blame it on me
when i dance alone , i know , i 'll go , blame it on me
when i lose control , i know , i 'll go , blame it on me
oooh , what you waiting for , now what you waiting for
oh , what you waiting for , now what you waiting for

home grown alligator , see you later
got ta hit the road , got ta hit the road
the sun and change in the atmosphere ,
architecture unfamiliar ,
i could get used to this
time flies by in the yellow and green ,
stick around and you ’ ll see what i mean .
there ’ s a mountain top , that i ’ m dreaming of ,
if you need me , you know where i ’ ll be .
i ’ ll be riding shotgun ,
underneath the hot sun ,
feeling like a someone .
i ’ ll be riding shotgun ,
underneath the hot sun ,
feeling like a someone .
the south of the equator , navigator ,
got ta hit the road , got ta hit the road .
deep-sea diving round the clock ,
bikini bottoms , lager tops
i could get used to this
time flies by in the yellow and green ,
stick around and you ’ ll see what i mean .
there ’ s a mountain top , that i ’ m dreaming of ,
if you need me , you know where i ’ ll be .
i ’ ll be riding shotgun ,
underneath the hot sun ,
feeling like a someone .
i ’ ll be riding shotgun ,
underneath the hot sun ,
feeling like a someone .
we got two in the front , two in the back ,
sailing along and we don ’ t look back .
time flies by in the yellow and green ,
stick around and you ’ ll see what i mean .
there ’ s a mountain top , that i ’ m dreaming of ,

song over
pick apart
the pieces of your heart
and let me peer inside
let me in
where only your thoughts have been
let me occupy your mind
as you do mine
you have lost -too much love-
to fear , doubt and distrust -its not enough-
you just threw away the key -to your heart-
you dont get burned -cause nothing gets through-
it makes it easier -easier on you-
but that much more difficult for me
to make you see ?
love aint fair
so there you are
my love
your hearts a mess
you wont admit to it
it makes no sense
but im desperate to connect
and you , you cant live like this
love aint safe
you wont get hurt if you stay chaste
so you can wait
but i dont wan na waste my love

she puts her makeup on like graffiti on the
walls of the heartland
she 's got her little book of conspiracies
right in her hand
she is paranoid like endangered species
headed into extinction
she is one of a kind
she 's the last of
the american girls
she wears her overcoat for the coming of
the nuclear winter
she is riding her bike like a fugitive
of critical mass
she 's on a hunger strike for the ones who wo n't
make it for dinner
she makes enough to survive
for a holiday of working class
she 's a runaway of the
establishment incorporated
she wo n't cooperate
she 's the last of
the american girls
vinyl records singing songs on the
even of destruction
she 's a sucker for all the criminals
breaking the laws
she will come in first for the end of the
western civilization
she 's an endless war like a hero for
the lost cause
like a hurricane
in the heart of
the devastation
she 's a natural disaster

song over
her eyes and words are so icy
oh but she burns
like rum on the fire
hot and fast and angry
as she can be
i walk my days on a wire .
it looks ugly , but it 's clean ,
oh momma , do n't fuss over me .
the way she tells me i 'm hers and she is mine
open hand or closed fist would be fine
the blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine .
calls of guilty fall on me
all while she stains
the sheets of some other
thrown at me so powerfully
just like she throws with the arm of her brother .
but i want it , it 's a crime
that she 's not around most of the time .
the way she shows me i 'm hers and she is mine
open hand or closed fist would be fine
blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine .
her fight and fury is fiery
oh but she loves
like sleep to the freezing
sweet and right and merciful
i 'm all but washed
in the tide of her breathing .
and it 's worth it , it 's divine
and i have this some of the time .
the way she shows me i 'm hers and she is mine
open hand or closed fist would be fine
the blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine .

babe ,
there 's something tragic about you
something so magic about you
do n't you agree
babe ,
there 's something lonesome about you
something so wholesome about you
get closer to me
no tight side , no rolling eyes , no irony
no 'who cares ' , no vacant stares , no time for me
honey you 're familiar like my mirror years ago
idealism sits in prison , chivalry fell on it 's sword
innocence died screaming , honey ask me i should know
i slithered here from eden just to sit outside your door
babe ,
there 's something wretched about this
something so precious about this
where to begin
babe ,
there 's something broken about this
but i might be open about this
oh what a sin
to the strand a picnic plan for you and me
a rope in hand for your other man to hang from a tree
honey you 're familiar like my mirror years ago
idealism sits in prison , chivalry fell on it 's sword
innocence died screaming , honey ask me i should know
i slithered here from eden just to sit outside your door
honey you 're familiar like my mirror years ago
idealism sits in prison , chivalry fell on it 's sword
innocence died screaming , honey ask me i should know

so tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
no better version of me i could pretend to be tonight
so deep in the swill with the most familiar of swine
for reasons wretched and divine
she blows out of nowhere roman candle of the wild
laughing her way through my feeble disguise
no other version of me i would rather be tonight
and lord she found me just in time
cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
i need to be youthfully felt 'cause god i never felt young
she 's gon na save me call me 'baby ' run her hands through my hair
she 'll know me crazy soothe me daily better yet she would n't care
we 'll steal a lexus be detectives ride 'round picking up clues
we 'll name our children jackie and wilson raise 'em on rhythm and blues
lord it 'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
me and my isis growing black irises in the sunshine
every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
sit back and watch the world go by
happy to lie back watch it burn and rust
we tried the world good god it was n't for us
she 's gon na save me call me 'baby ' run her hands through my hair
she 'll know me crazy soothe me daily better yet she would n't care
we 'll steal a lexus be detectives ride 'round picking up clues
we 'll name our children jackie and wilson raise 'em on rhythm and blues
cut clean from the dream that night let my mind reset
lookin ' up from a cigarette and she 's already left
i start diggin ' up the yard for what 's left of me and our little vignette
for whatever poor soul is coming next
she 's gon na save me call me 'baby ' run her hands through my hair
she 'll know me crazy soothe me daily better yet she would n't care
we 'll steal a lexus be detectives ride 'round picking up clues
we 'll name our children jackie and wilson raise 'em on rhythm and blues
song over
i had a thought dear
however scary
about that night
the bugs and the dirt .
why were you digging ?
what did you bury
before those hands pulled me
from the earth ?
i will not ask you where you came from
i will not ask and neither should you
honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
we should just kiss like real people do
i knew that look dear
eyes always seeking
was there in someone
that dug long ago
so i will not ask you
why you were creeping
in some sad way i already know
so i will not ask you where you came from
i will not ask and neither should you
honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
we should just kiss like real people do
i could not ask you where you came from
i could not ask and neither could you
honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
we could just kiss like real people do
song over
do n't take this the wrong way
you knew who i was every step that i ran to you
only blue or black day
electing strange perfections in any stranger i choose
would things be easier if there was a right way
honey there is no right way
and so i fall in love just a little ol ' little bit
every day with someone new
and so i fall in love just a little ol ' little bit
every day with someone new
and so i fall in love just a little ol ' little bit
every day with someone new
and so i fall in love just a little ol ' little bit
every day with someone new
there 's an art to life 's distractions
somehow escapes the burning weight the art of scraping through
some like to imagine
the dark thrills of someone else i guess any thrill will do
would things be easier if there was a right way
honey there is no right way
and so i fall in love just a little ol ' little bit
every day with someone new
and so i fall in love just a little ol ' little bit
every day with someone new
and so i fall in love just a little ol ' little bit
every day with someone new
and so i fall in love just a little ol ' little bit
every day with someone new
i wake at the first crink of morning
and my heart 's already sent .
how could your sweet love and you would pray for him
love with every stranger the stranger the better -x6-
i fall in love just a little ol ' little bit every day with someone new

my lover 's got humour
she 's the giggle at a funeral
knows everybody 's disapproval
i should 've worshipped her sooner
if the heavens ever did speak
she is the last true mouth piece
every sunday 's getting more bleak
a fresh poison each week
'we were born sick , you heard them say it
my church offers no absolutes
she tells me 'worship in the bedroom '
the only heaven i 'll be sent to
is when i 'm alone with you
i was born sick , but i love it
aaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaamen . aaaaaaaamen . amen
take me to church
i 'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i 'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
good god , let me give you my life
take me to church
i 'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i 'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death
good god , let me give you my life
no masters or kings when the ritual begins
there is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
in the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
only then i am human
only then i am clean
amen . amen . amen
take me to church
i 'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
i 'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
offer me that deathless death

boys workin on empty
is that the kinda way to face the burning heat ?

i 'm so full of love i could barely eat
there 's nothing sweeter than my baby
i never want once from the cherry tree

she give me toothaches just from kissin me
when , my , time comes around
lay me gently in the cold dark earth
no grave can hold my body down
i 'll crawl home to her
that 's when my baby found me
i was three days on a drunken sin
i woke with her walls around me
nothin in her room but an empty crib
and i was burnin up a fever
i did n't care much how long i lived
but i swear i thought i dreamed her
she never asked me once about the wrong i did
when , my , time comes around
lay me gently in the cold dark earth
no grave can hold my body down
i 'll crawl home to her
my baby never fret none
about what my hands and my body done
if the lord do n't forgive me
i 'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
when i was kissing on my baby
and she put her love down soft and sweet
in the lowland plot i was free
heaven and hell were words to me
when , my , time comes around
lay me gently in the cold dark earth
no grave can hold my body down
i 'll crawl home to her

song over
i 'm bleeding out
so if the last thing that i do
is bring you down
i 'll bleed out for
so i bare my skin
and i count my sins
and i close my eyes and i take it in
i 'm bleeding out
i 'm bleeding out for you
for you
when the day has come
that i 've lost my way around
and the seasons stop
and hide beneath the ground
when the sky turns grey
and everything is screaming
i will reach inside
just to find my heart is beating
oh you tell me to hold on
oh you tell me to hold on
but innocence is gone
and what was right is wrong
cause i 'm bleeding out
so if the last thing that i do
is bring you down
i 'll bleed out for you
so i bare my skin
and i count my sins
and i close my eyes and i take it in
i 'm bleeding out
i 'm bleeding out for you
for you
when the hour is nigh
and hopelessness is sinking in
and the wolves all cry
to fill the night with hollering
when your eyes are red
and emptiness is all you know
with the darkness fed
i will be your scarecrow
you tell me to hold on
oh you tell me to hold on
but innocence is gone
and what was right is wrong
cause i 'm bleeding out
so if the last thing that i do
is bring you down
i 'll bleed out for you
so i bare my skin
and i count my sins
and i close my eyes and i take it in
i 'm bleeding out
i 'm bleeding out for you
for you
cause i 'm bleeding out
so if the last thing that i do
is bring you down
i 'll bleed out for you
so i bare my skin
and i count my sins
and i close my eyes and i take it in
i 'm bleeding out
i 'm bleeding out for you
for you
song over
i know i took the path that you would never want for me
i know i let you down , did n't i ?
so many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me
well i 'm just a slave unto the night
now remember when i told you that 's the last you 'll see of me
remember when i broke you down to tears
i know i took the path that you would never want for me
i gave you hell through all the years
so i , i bet my life , i bet my life , i bet my life on you
i , i bet my life , i bet my life , i bet my life on you
i 've been around the world but never in my wildest dreams
would i come running home to you
i 've told a million lies but now i tell a single truth
there 's you in everything i do
now remember when i told you that 's the last you 'll see of me
remember when i broke you down to tears
i know i took the path that you would never want for me
i gave you hell through all the years
so i , i bet my life , i bet my life , i bet my life on you
i , i bet my life , i bet my life , i bet my life on you
do n't tell me that i 'm wrong
i 've walked that road before and left you on your own
and please believe them when they say
that it 's left for yesterday and the records that i 've played
please forgive for all i 've done
so i , i bet my life , i bet my life , i bet my life on you
i , i bet my life , i bet my life , i bet my life on you
song over
so this is what you meant when you said that you were spent ?
and now it 's time to build from the bottom of the pit right to the top ,
packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check
i do n't ever want to let you down
i do n't ever want to leave this town
'cause after all
it 's time to begin , is n't it ?
i get a little bit bigger , but then ,
i 'll admit , i 'm just the same as i was
now do n't you understand
so this is where you fell , and i am left to sell
the path that heaven runs through miles of clouded hell ,
right to the top
turning to rags and give the commodities a rain check
i do n't ever want to let you down
i do n't ever want to leave this town
'cause after all
it 's time to begin , is n't it ?
i get a little bit bigger , but then ,
i 'll admit , i 'm just the same as i was
now do n't you understand
this road never looked so lonely ,
this house does n't burn down slowly ,
to ashes , to ashes ...
it 's time to begin , is n't it ?
i get a little bit bigger , but then ,
i 'll admit , i 'm just the same as i was
now do n't you understand
song over
will you hold the line
in this house of mine
will the stars align ?
'cause this house of mine stands strong
that 's the price you pay
leave behind your heartache , cast away
just another product of today
rather be the hunter than the prey
natural
you got ta be so cold
yeah , you 're a natural
you got ta be so cold

rather be the hunter than the prey

yeah , you 're a natural

took an oath by the blood of my hand , wo n't break it

as a child , you would wait
and watch from far away .
but you always knew that you 'd be the one
the one that work while they all play .
in youth , you 'd lay ,
awake at night and scheme
of all the things that you would change ,
but it was just a dream .
here we are , do n't turn away now ,
we are the warriors that built this town .
here we are , do n't turn away now ,
we are the warriors that built this town
from dust
the time will come ,
when you 'll have to rise
above the best , and prove yourself ,
your spirit never dies !
farewell , i 've gone ,
to take my throne above ,
but do n't weep for me , 'cuz this will be
the labor of my love
here we are , do n't turn away now ,
we are the warriors that built this town .

every pot of gold fill and full of distortion
heaven was a place still in space not in motion
but soon
i got you
i got everything
i ’ ve got you
i don ’ t need nothing
more than you
i got everything
i ’ ve got you
we went walking through the hills
tryin ’ to pretend that we both know
maybe if we save up
we can build a little home
but then the hell storm came and yelled ,
“ you need to let go , you ’ ve got no control . no . ”
i got you
i got everything
i ’ ve got you
i don ’ t need nothing
more than you
i got everything

this weight ’ s too much alone
some days i ca n't hold it at all

roll me over slowly
stick a knot inside of me
and twist it all around

grab my fingers gently
slam them in a doorway put my
face into the ground
i want love to
murder my own mother and
take her off to somewhere
like hell or up above
and i want love to
change my friends to enemies
change my friends to enemies and show me
how it 's all my fault
i wo n't let
love disrupt ,

walk right up and bite me
grab a hold of me and fight me
and leave me dying on the ground
i want love to
split my mouth wide open and
cover up my ears and never
let me hear a sound
i want love to
admit that you offended me
or how you have defended me when
everybody talked me down

tried to square not being there

hold back the river , let me look in your eyes
hold back the river so i
can stop for a minute and see where you hide
hold back the river , hold back
once upon a different life
we rode our bikes into the sky
but now we crawl against the tide
those distant days are flashing by
hold back the river , let me look in your eyes
can stop for a minute and be by your side
hold back the river , hold back
hold back the river , let me look in your eyes
can stop for a minute and see where you hide
hold back the river , hold back

do n't know what to say to you now
standing right in front of you
do n't know how to fade in and out
do n't know how to play it cool
losing a little guard , let it down
we do n't have to think it through
we 've got to let go
i wan na give you wild love
the kind that never slows down
i wan na take you high up
let our hearts be the only sound
i wan na go where the lights burn low and you 're only mine
i wan na give you wild love
tried to call you , to feel you close
from a runway in tokyo
let 's leave the atmosphere , disappear
there 's always something left to lose
i wan na give you wild love
the kind that never slows down
i wan na take you high up
let our hearts be the only sound
i wan na go where the lights burn low and you 're only mine
i wan na give you wild love
let 's be reckless , unaffected
running out until we 're breathless
let 's be hopeful , do n't get broken
and stay caught up in the moment
i wan na give you wild love
the kind that never slows down
i wan na take you high up
let our hearts be the only sound
i wan na go where the lights burn low and you 're only mine

song over
it was only a smile but my heart it went wild
and i was n't expecting that
just a delicate kiss , anyone could 've missed
i was n't expecting that
did i misread the sign ? your hand slipped into mine
i was n't expecting that
you spent the night in my bed , you woke up and you said
`` well , i was n't expecting that ''
i thought love was n't meant to last ,
i thought you were just passing through
if i ever get the nerve to ask
what did i get right to deserve somebody like you ?
i was n't expecting that
it was only a word , it was almost mis-heard
'cause i was n't expecting that
but it came without fear , a month turned into a year
and i was n't expecting that
i thought love was n't meant to last ,
i thought you were just passing through
if i ever get the nerve to ask
what did i get right to deserve somebody like you ?
is n't it strange how a life can be changed
in the flicker of the sweetest smile
we were married in spring
you know i would n't change a thing
without an innocent kiss , what a life i 'd have missed ,
if you 'd not took a chance on a little romance
when i was n't expecting that
time does n't take long , three kids up and gone
and i was n't expecting that
and when the nurses they came , said its come back again
i was n't expecting that
then you closed your eyes , took my heart by surprise
and i was n't expecting that
song over
if i could save time in a bottle
the first thing that i 'd like to do
is to save every day till eternity passes away
just to spend them with you .
if i could make days last forever
if words could make wishes come true
i 'd save every day like a treasure and then
again , i would spend them with you .
but there never seems to be enough time
to do the things you want to do once you find them
i 've looked around enough to know
that you 're the one i want to go through time with .
if i had a box just for wishes
and dreams that had never come true
the box would be empty except for the memory
of how they were answered by you
but there never seems to be enough time
to do the things you want to do once you find them
i 've looked around enough to know
that you 're the one i want to go through time with .
song over
hey , do n't write yourself off yet .
it 's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on .
just try your best , try everything you can .
and do n't you worry what they tell themselves when you 're away .
it just takes some time , little girl you 're in the middle of the ride everything ,
everything will be just fine , everything , everything will be all right - all right -
hey , you know they 're all the same .
you know you 're doing better on your own , so do n't buy in .
live right now . yeah , just be yourself .
it does n't matter if it 's good enough for someone else .
it just takes some time , little girl you 're in the middle of the ride everything ,
everything will be just fine , everything , everything will be all right - all right -
hey , do n't write yourself off yet .
it 's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on .
just do your best , do everything you can .
and do n't you worry what the bitter hearts are gon na say .
it just takes some time , little girl you 're in the middle of the ride everything ,
everything will be just fine , everything , everything will be all right - all right -
it just takes some time , little girl you 're in the middle of the ride everything ,
everything will be just fine , everything , everything will be all right - all right -

song over
i was born in the arms of imaginary friends
free to roam , made a home out of everywhere i 've been
then you come crashing in
like the realest thing
trying my best to understand all that your love can bring
oh , half of my heart 's got a grip on the situation
half of my heart takes time
half of my heart 's got the right mind to tell you that
i can ` t keep loving you
oh , half of my heart
i was made to believe i 'd never love somebody else
i made a plan , stayed the man who can only love himself
lonely was the song i sang
'til the day you came
showing me a better way and all that my love can bring
oh , half of my heart 's got a grip on the situation
half of my heart takes time
half of my heart 's got the right mind to tell you that
i can ` t keep loving you
oh , half of my heart with half of my heart
your faith is strong
but i can only fall so far so long
time to hold , later on
you will hate that i never gave more to you
than half of my heart
but i ca n't stop loving you
but i ca n't stop loving you
but i ca n't stop loving you
with half of my , half of my heart
oh , half of my heart
half of my heart 's got a real good imagination
half of my heart 's got you
half of my heart 's got a right mind to tell you
that half of my heart wo n't do
half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
half of my heart is the part of a man who 's never
truly loved anything
oh , half of my heart
oh , half of my heart
half of my heart
oh , half of my heart
half of my heart
oh , half of my heart
half of my heart
song over
lightning strikes
inside , my chest to keep me up at night
dream of ways
to make you understand my pain
clouds of sulfur in the air
bombs are falling everywhere
it 's heartbreak warfare
once you want it to begin ,
no one really ever wins
in heartbreak warfare
if you want more love ,
why do n't you say so ?
if you want more love ,
why do n't you say so ?
drop his name
push it in and twist the knife again
watch my face
as i pretend to feel no pain
clouds of sulfur in the air
bombs are falling everywhere
it 's heartbreak warfare
once you want it to begin ,
no one really ever wins
in heartbreak warfare .
if you want more love ,
why do n't you say so ?
if you want more love ,
why do n't you say so ?
just say so ...
how come the only way to know how high you get me
is to see how far i fall
god only knows how much i 'd love you if you let me
but i ca n't break through at all .
it 's a heartbreak ...
i do n't care if we do n't sleep at all tonight
let 's just fix this whole thing now
i swear to god we 're gon na get it right
if you lay your weapon down
red wine and ambien
you 're talking *xxxx* again , it 's heartbreak warfare
good to know it 's all a game
disappointment has a name , it 's heartbreak , heartbreak .
song over
paper doll , come try it on
step out of that black chiffon
heres a dress of gold and blue
sure was fun being good to you
this one we made just for fall
and winter runs a bit too small
this mint green is new for spring
my love didnt cost a thing
youre like twenty-two girls in one
and none of them know what theyre runnin from
was it just too far to fall ?
for a little paper doll
fold a scarf , moroccan red
and tie your hair behind your head
strap into some heels that hurt
you shouldve kept my undershirt
youre like twenty-two girls in one
and none of them know what theyre runnin from
was it just too far to fall ?
for a little paper doll
cut the cord and pull some strings
and make yourself some angel wings
and if those angel wings dont fly
someones gon na paint you another sky
cause youre like twenty-two girls in one
and none of them know what theyre runnin from
was it just too far to fall ?
song over
goodbye cold , goodbye rain
goodbye sorrow , goodbye shame
i 'm headed out west with my headphones on
boarded a flight with a song in the back of my soul
and no one knows
i just found out her ghost left town
the queen of california is stepping down , down
hello beauty , hello strange
hello wonder , what 's your name ?
looking for the sun that neil young hung
after the gold rush of 1971
i just found out her ghost left town
the queen of california is stepping down , down
if you see her say , `` hello ''
just do n't tell me , `` i told you so ''
joni wrote blue in her house by the sea
i got ta believe there ’ s another color waiting on me
to set me free
i just found out her ghost left town
the queen of california is stepping down , down

money is the anthem
of success
so before we go out
i 'm your national anthem
god , you 're so handsome
take me to the hamptons
he loves to romance them
reckless abandon
holdin ' me for ransom
he says to `` be cool '' but
i do n't know how yet
wind in my hair
hand on the back of my neck
i said , `` can we party later on ? ''
he said , `` yes , yes ''
tell me i 'm your national anthem
tell me i 'm your national anthem
red , white , blue 's in the skies
summer 's in the air and
baby , heaven 's in your eyes
i 'm your national anthem
money is the reason
we exist
everybody knows it , it 's a fact
i sing the national anthem
while i 'm standing over your body
and you ca n't keep your hands off me
see what you 've done to me
you said to `` be cool '' but
i 'm already coolest
you said to `` get real ''
um , do you think you 'll buy me lots of diamonds ?
-yes , also a gun-
tell me i 'm your national anthem
tell me i 'm your national anthem
red , white , blue 's in the skies
summer 's in the air and
baby , heaven 's in your eyes
i 'm your national anthem
it 's a love story for the new age
for the six page
wining and dining
excessive buying
on our drugs and our love
blurring the lines between real and the fake
dark and lonely
i need somebody to hold me
we will do very well
i can tell , i can tell
keep my safe in his bell tower , hotel
money is the anthem of success
so put on mascara , and your party dress
i 'm your national anthem
boy , put your hands up
give me a standing ovation
boy , you have landed
babe , in the land of
sweetness and danger
tell me i 'm your national anthem
tell me i 'm your national anthem

i 've seen the world
done it all , had my cake now
diamonds , brilliant , and bel-air now
hot summer nights mid july
when you and i were forever wild
the crazy days , the city lights
the way you 'd play with me like a child
will you still love me when i 'm no longer young and beautiful
will you still love me when i got nothing but my aching soul
i know you will , i know you will
i know that you will
will you still love me when i 'm no longer beautiful
i 've seen the world , lit it up as my stage now
channeling angels in , the new age now
hot summer days , rock and roll
the way you 'd play for me at your show
and all the ways i got to know
your pretty face and electric soul
will you still love me when i 'm no longer young and beautiful
will you still love me when i got nothing but my aching soul
i know you will , i know you will
i know that you will
will you still love me when i 'm no longer beautiful
dear lord when i get to heaven
please let me bring my man
when he comes tell me that you 'll let me
father tell me if you can
oh that grace , oh that body
oh that face makes me wan na party
he 's my sun , he makes shine like diamonds
will you still love me when i 'm no longer young and beautiful
will you still love me when i got nothing but my aching soul
i know you will , i know you will
i know that you will
will you still love me when i 'm no longer beautiful
will you still love me when i 'm no longer beautiful
will you still love me when i 'm not young and beautiful
song over
i 've heard there was a secret chord
that david played , and it pleased the lord
but you do n't really care for music , do you ?
it goes like this , the fourth , the fifth
the minor fall , the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah
hallelujah , hallelujah
hallelujah , hallelujah
your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
she tied you
to a kitchen chair
she broke your throne ,
she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah
hallelujah , hallelujah
hallelujah , hallelujah
maybe i 've been here before
i know this room , i 've walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew you
i 've seen your flag on the marble arch
love is not a victory march
it 's a cold and it 's a broken hallelujah
hallelujah , hallelujah
hallelujah , hallelujah
there was a time you 'd let me know
what 's real and going on below
but now you never show it to me do you ?
remember when i moved in you ?
the holy dark was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah
hallelujah , hallelujah
hallelujah , hallelujah
maybe there 's a god above
and all i ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
it 's not a cry you can hear at night
it 's not somebody who 's seen the light
it 's a cold and it 's a broken hallelujah
hallelujah , hallelujah
hallelujah , hallelujah
hallelujah , hallelujah
hallelujah , hallelujah

memories consume
i do n't want to be the one
the battles always choose
'cause inside i realize
that i 'm the one confused
i do n't know what 's worth fighting for
or why i have to scream .
i do n't know why i instigate
and say what i do n't mean .
i do n't know how i got this way
i know it 's not alright .
so i 'm breaking the habit ,
i 'm breaking the habit
tonight
clutching my cure
i try to catch my breath again
i hurt much more
i had no options left again
i do n't want to be the one
the battles always choose
'cause inside i realize
that i 'm the one confused
i do n't know what 's worth fighting for
or why i have to scream .
i do n't know why i instigate
and say what i do n't mean .
i do n't know how i got this way
i know it 's not alright .
so i 'm breaking the habit ,
i 'm breaking the habit
tonight
i 'll paint it on the walls
'cause i 'm the one that falls
i 'll never fight again
and this is how it ends
i do n't know what 's worth fighting for
or why i have to scream .
but now i have some clarity
to show you what i mean .
i do n't know how i got this way
i know it 's not alright .
so i 'm breaking the habit ,
i 'm breaking the habit
i 'm breaking the habit
tonight
song over
take me down to the river bend ,
take me down to the fighting end ,
wash the poison from off my skin
show me how to be whole again
fly me up on a silver wing
past the black where the siren sing
warm me up in a nova 's glow
and drop me down to the dream below
cause i 'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see .
for you to see
bring me home in blinding dream
through the secrets that i have seen
wash the sorrow from off my skin
and show me how to be whole again
cause i 'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see .
for you to see
cause i 'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything else i need to be
cause i 'm only a crack in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see .
for you to see
song over
i am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
handful of complaints but i can ’ t help the fact that everyone can see these scars
i am what i want you to want what i want you to feel
but it 's like no matter what i do , i ca n't convince you , to just believe this is real
so i let go , watching you , turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that i 'm not
but i 'll be here 'cause you 're all that i got
i ca n't feel the way i did before
do n't turn your back on me
i wo n't be ignored
time wo n't heal this damage anymore
do n't turn your back on me
i wo n't be ignored
i am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
cause you do n't understand i do what i can but sometimes i do n't make sense
i am what you never wan na say but i 've never had a doubt
it 's like no matter what i do i ca n't convince you for once just to hear me out
so i let go watching you turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that i 'm not
but i 'll be here 'cause you 're all that i 've got
i ca n't feel the way i did before
do n't turn your back on me
i wo n't be ignored
time wo n't heal this damage anymore
do n't turn your back on me
i wo n't be ignored
- no -
- hear me out now -

song over
when you were standing in the wake of devastation
when you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
with the cataclysm raining down , insides crying save me now
you were there and possibly alone
do you feel cold and lost in desperation
you build up all the failures all you 've known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go , oh oh oh oh , let it go
and in the burst of light that blinded every angel
as if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
you felt the gravity of temper grace falling into empty space
no one there to catch you in there arms
do you feel cold and lost in desperation
you build up all the failures all you 've known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go , oh oh oh oh , let it go
do you feel cold and lost in desperation
you build up all the failures all you 've known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go , oh oh oh oh
let it go oh oh oh , oh
let it go oh oh oh , oh
let it go oh oh oh , oh
let it go oh oh oh
do you feel cold and lost in desperation
you build up all the failures all you 've known
remember all the sadness and frustration
and let it go , oh oh oh oh , let it go
song over
i dreamed i was missing
you were so scared
but no one would listen
‘ cause no one else cares
after my dreaming
i woke with this fear
what am i leaving ?
when i 'm done here
so if you 're asking me i want you to know
when my time comes
forget the wrong that i 've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
and do n't resent me
and when you 're feeling empty
keep me in your memory
leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
do n't be afraid
i 've taken my beating
i 've shed but i 'm me
i 'm strong on the surface
not all the way through
i 've never been perfect
but neither have you
so if you 're asking me i want you to know
when my time comes
forget the wrong that i 've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
and do n't resent me
and when you 're feeling empty
keep me in your memory
leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
forgetting all the hurt inside
you 've learned to hide so well
pretending someone else can come and save me
from myself
i ca n't be who you are
when my time comes
forget the wrong that i 've done
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
and do n't resent me
and when you 're feeling empty
keep me in your memory
leave out all the rest
leave out all the rest
forgetting all the hurt inside
you 've learned to hide so well
pretending someone else can come and save me
from myself
i ca n't be who you are
i ca n't be who you are
song over
i 'm tired of being what you want me to be
feeling so faithless lost under the surface
do n't know what you 're expecting of me
put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
every step i take is another mistake to you
i 've become so numb i ca n't feel you there
i 've become so tired so much more aware
i 've becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
ca n't you see that you 're smothering me
holding too tightly afraid to lose control
cause everything that you thought i would be
has fallen apart right in front of you
every step that i take is another mistake to you
and every second i waste is more than i can take
i 've become so numb i ca n't feel you there
i 've become so tired so much more aware
i 've becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
and i know
i may end up failing too
but i know
you were just like me with someone disappointed in you
i 've become so numb i ca n't feel you there
i 've become so tired so much more aware
i 've becoming this all i want to do
is be more like me and be less like you
i 've become so numb i ca n't feel you there
- tired of being what you want me to be -
i 've become so numb i ca n't feel you there
- tired of being what you want me to be -
song over
should 've stayed , were there signs , i ignored ?
can i help you , not to hurt , anymore ?
we saw brilliance , when the world , was asleep
there are things that we can have , but ca n't keep if they say
who cares if one more light goes out ?
in a sky of a million stars
who cares when someone 's time runs out ?
if a moment is all we are
who cares if one more light goes out ?
well i ... do
the reminders , pull the floor from your feet
in the kitchen , one more chair than you need oh
and you 're angry , and you should be , it 's not fair
just 'cause you ca n't see it , does n't mean it , is n't there if they say
who cares if one more light goes out ?
in a sky of a million stars
who cares when someone 's time runs out ?
if a moment is all we are
who cares if one more light goes out ?
well i ... do
who cares if one more light goes out ?
in a sky of a million stars
who cares when someone 's time runs out ?
if a moment is all we are
who cares if one more light goes out ?
well i ... do
song over
this is not the end , this is not the beginning ,
just a voice like a riot , rocking every revision
but you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
though the words sound steady something empty 's within 'em
waiting for the end to come
wishing i had strength to stand
this is not what i had planned
it 's out of my controoooool ... .
- oh ! - i know what it takes to move on ,
i know how it feels to lie ,
all i wan na do
is trade this life for something new
holding on to what i have n't gooooot
sitting in an empty room
trying to forget the past
this was never meant to last ,
i wish it was n't so ...
this is not the end this is not the beginning ,
just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
- holding on to what i have n't got - but you listen to the tone and the violet rhythm though the words sound steady something empty 's within 'em
- holding on to what i have n't got ! -
song over
in this farewell
there 's no blood
there 's no alibi
'cause i 've drawn regret
from the truth
of a thousand lies
so let mercy come and wash away
what i 've done
i 'll face myself
to cross out what i 've become
erase myself and let go of
what i 've done
put to rest
what you thought of me
while i clean this slate
with the hands
of uncertainty
so let mercy come and wash away
what i 've done
i 'll face myself
to cross out what i 've become
erase myself and let go of
what i 've done
for what i 've done
i 'll start again
and whatever thing may come
today this ends i 'm forgiving
what i 've done
i 'll face myself
to cross out what i 've become
erase myself and let go of
what i 've done
what i 've done
forgiving what i 've done

that slow burn wait while it gets dark
bruising the sun
i feel grown up with you in your car
i know it 's dumb

not sleeping is one

i 'm biting my tongue
ooooooooooooh ooooooooh

let 'em talk 'cause we 're dancing in this world alone
world alone
we 're alone
all my fake friends and all of their noise
complain about work
they 're studying business , i study the floor
and you have n't stopped smoking all night
maybe the internet raised us
or maybe people are jerks -people are talking , people are talking-
but not you -people are talking , people are talking-
raise a glass 'cause i 'm not done saying it
they all wan na get rough , get away with it
let 'em talk 'cause we 're dancing in this world alone

all the double-edged people and schemes
they make a mess , then go home and get clean
you 're my best friend and we 're dancing in a world alone
world alone
we 're all alone
i know we 're no-ot everlasting
we 're a train wreck waiting to happen
one day the blood wo n't flow so gladly
one day we 'll all get still -people are talking , people are talking-

all my life ,
i 've been fighting a war
i ca n't talk to you or your friends
it 's not only you ,
my heart jumps around when i 'm eluded to
this will not do
cause i was raised up to be admired ,
to be noticed
but when you 're withdrawn ,
it 's the closest thing
to assault when all eyes are on you
this will not do
i 'm faking glory
lick my lips toss my hair
and send a smile over
and the story brand new
i can take it from here ,
i 'll find my own bravado
it 's a switch flipped
it 's a switch flipped
it 's a moon eclipsed , oh
and i can tell that , when the lights come on i 'll be ready for this
it 's in your bloodstream
it 's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size
i was frightened of every little thing
that i thought was out to get me down
to trip me up , and laugh at me ,
but i learned not to hold the quiet of the room
and the one around to find me out
song over
i remember when your head caught flame
it kissed your scalp and caressed your brain -i remember when your head
caught flame-
well you laughed , baby it 's okay
it 's buzzcut season anyway -well you laughed , baby it 's okay-
explosions on tv
and all the girls with heads inside a dream
so now we live beside the pool
where everything is good
we ride the bus with the knees pulled in
people should see how we 're living -we ride the bus with the knees pulled in-
shut my eyes to the song that plays
sometimes this has a hot , sweet taste -shut my eyes to the song that plays-
the men up on the news
they try to tell us all that we will lose
but it 's so easy in this blue
where everything is good
and i 'll never go home again -place the call , feel it start-
favourite friend -and nothing 's wrong when nothing 's true-
i live in a hologram with you
we 're all the things that we do for fun -and i 'll breathe and it goes-
play along -make believe , it 's hyper real-
but i live in a hologram with you
cola with the burnt-out taste
i 'm the one you tell your fears to
there 'll never be enough of us
explosions on tv
and all the girls with heads inside a dream
so now we live beside the pool
where everything is good
and i 'll never go home again -place the call , feel it start-
favourite friend -and nothing 's wrong when nothing 's true-
i live in a hologram with you
we 're all the things that we do for fun -and i 'll breathe and it goes-
play along -make believe , it 's hyper real-
but i live in a hologram with you
song over
there 's a humming in the restless summer air
and we 're slipping off the course that we prepared
but in all chaos , there is calculation
dropping glasses just to hear them break
you 've been drinking like the world was gon na end -it didn't-
took a shiner from the fist of your best friend -go figure-
it 's clear that someone 's got ta go
we mean it , but i promise we 're not mean
and the cry goes out
they lose their minds for us
and how it plays out
now we 're in the ring
and we 're coming for blood
you could try and take us
but we 're the gladiators
everyone a rager
but secretly they 're saviors
glory and gore go hand in hand
that 's why we 're making headlines
you could try and take us
but victory 's contagious
delicate in every way but one -the swordplay-
god knows we like archaic kinds of fun -the old way-
chance is the only game i play with , baby
we let our battles choose us
and the cry goes out
they lose their minds for us
and how it plays out
now we 're in the ring
and we 're coming for blood
you could try and take us
but we 're the gladiators
everyone a rager
but secretly they 're saviors
glory and gore go hand in hand
that 's why we 're making headlines
you could try and take us
but victory 's contagious
no-one 'round here 's good at keeping their eyes closed
the sun 's starting to light up when we 're walking home
tired little laughs , gold lie promises , we 'll always win at this
i do n't ever think about death
it 's alright if you do , it 's fine
we gladiate but i guess we 're really fighting ourselves
roughing up our minds so we 're ready when the kill time comes
wide awake in bed , words in my brain , `` secretly you love this
do you even wan na go free ? ''
let me in the ring , i 'll show you what that big word means
you could try and take us
but we 're the gladiators
everyone a rager
but secretly they 're saviors
glory and gore go hand in hand
that 's why we 're making headlines
you could try and take us
but victory 's contagious
song over
the drink you spilt all over me
lover 's spit left on repeat
my mum and dad let me stay home
it drives you crazy getting old
we can talk it so good
we can make it so divine
we can talk it good
how you wish it would be all the time
the drink you spilt all over me
lover 's spit left on repeat
my mum and dad let me stay home
it drives you crazy getting old
the drink you spilt all over me
lover 's spit left on repeat
my mum and dad let me stay home
it drives you crazy getting old
this dream is n't feeling sweet
we 're reeling through the midnight streets
and i 've never felt more alone
it feels so scary getting old
we can talk it so good
we can make it so divine
we can talk it good
how you wish it would be all the time
this dream is n't feeling sweet
we 're reeling through the midnight streets
and i 've never felt more alone
it feels so scary getting old
this dream is n't feeling sweet
we 're reeling through the midnight streets
and i 've never felt more alone
it feels so scary getting old
i want 'em back -i want 'em back-
how all the thoughts -how all the thoughts-
i want 'em back -i want 'em back-
it 's not enough to feel the lack -i want 'em back , i want 'em back-
you 're the only friend i need -you 're the only friend i need-
sharing beds like little kids -sharing beds like little kids-
and laughing 'til our ribs get tough -and laughing 'til our ribs get tough-
but that will never be enough -but that will never be enough-
you 're the only friend i need -you 're the only friend i need-
sharing beds like little kids -sharing beds like little kids-
and laughing 'til our ribs get tough -and laughing 'til our ribs get tough-
but that will never be enough -but that will never be enough-
that will never be enough that will never be enough that will never be enough that will never be enough
song over
today is my birthday and i 'm riding high
hair is dripping , hiding that i 'm terrified
but this is summer , playing dumber than in fall
everything i say falls right back into everything
i 'm not in the swing of things
not in the swing of things yet
riding around on the bikes , we 're still sane
i wo n't be her , tripping over onstage
hey , it 's all cool
i still like hotels but i think that 'll change
still like hotels and my new-found fame
hey , promise i can stay good
-everything feels right-
i 'm little but i 'm coming for the crown
-chase paper , get it-
i 'm little but i 'm coming for the title
held by everyone who 's up
all work and no play
never made me lose it
all business , all day
keeps me up a level
all work and no play
keeps me on the new xxxx , yeah
all work and no play
let me count the bruises
all business , all day
keeps me up a level
all work and no play
lonely on that new xxxx , yeah , yeah
only bad people live to see
their likeness set in stone
only bad people live to see
their likeness set in stone
i 'm not in the swing of things
not in the swing of things yet
i 'm not in the swing of things
not in the swing of things yet
all work and no play
never made me lose it
all business , all day
keeps me up a level
all work and no play
keeps me on the new xxxx , yeah
song over
call all the ladies out
a hundreds jewels on throats
a hundred jewels between teeth
now bring my boys in
the moon we love like a brother , while he glows through the room
dancin ' around the lies we tell
even the comatose they don ’ t dance and tell
we live in cities you 'll never see on screen
not very pretty , but we sure know how to run free
living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
and you know , we 're on each other 's team
i 'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air , so there
we live in cities you 'll never see on screen
not very pretty , but we sure know how to run free
living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
and you know , we 're on each other 's team
i ’ m kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
i ’ m kinda older than i was when i rebelled without a care
we live in cities you 'll never see on screen
not very pretty , but we sure know how to run free
living in ruins of the palace within my dreams
and you know , we 're on each other 's team
and you know , we 're on each other 's team
we 're on each other 's team
we 're on each other 's team
and you know , and you know , and you know
song over
do n't you think that it 's boring how people talk
making smart with their words again , well i 'm bored
because i 'm doing this for the thrill of it , killin ' it
never not chasing a million things i want
and i am only as young as the minute is full of it
getting pumped up from the little bright things i bought
baby be the class clown
i 'll be the beauty queen in tears
it 's a new art form showing people how little we care -yeah-
we 're so happy , even when we 're smilin ' out of fear
let 's go down to the tennis court , and talk it up like yeah -yeah-
baby be the class clown
i 'll be the beauty queen in tears
it 's a new art form showing people how little we care -yeah-

song over
i 'm in a clique but i want out
it 's not the same as when i was punched
the card games and ease with the bitter song of blood
my mother 's love is choking me
what about the kid ? it 's time the kid got free
we are proud of the love club
everything will glow for you
go get punched for the love club
for the love club .
i joined the club and it 's all on
there are fights for being my best friend
there 's something about hanging out the wicked kids
the other day i forgot my old address
except to be alone .
we are proud of the love club
everything will glow for you
go get punched for the love club
for the love club .
your clothes are soaked and you do n't know where to go
and roll out your maps and papers
find out your hiding places again
is how you 're severed from the people who watched you grow up
we are proud of the love club
everything will glow for you
go get punched for the love club
for the love club .
song over
we would n't be seen dead here in the day
i guess you 're lucky that it 's dark now
and if i like it then we 'll stay
impress the empress , take a shot now
we got the glow in our mouths
white teeth teens are out -out-
white teeth teens are up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning , but we got our methods
and there 's nothing here to stop , to stop this
if you want , we 'll help tonight to split its seams
give the bruises out like gifts aaahhh
you 'll get the picture of your dreams
i wo n't be smiling but the notes from my admirers
fill the dashboard just the same ah ah ah
we got the glow in our mouths
white teeth teens are out -out-
white teeth teens are up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning , but we got our methods
and there 's nothing here to stop , to stop us when we 're up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning , but we got our methods
and there 's nothing here to stop , to stop this
-and everything works out so good
i wear the robe like no one could-
i 'll let you in on something big
i 'm not a white teeth teen
i tried to join but never did
the way they are , the way they seem
is something else , it 's in the blood
their molars blinking like the lights
in the underpass where we all sit
and do nothing and love it
-everything works out so good
i wear the robe like no one could
everything works out so good
i wear the robe like no one could-
we got the glow in our mouths
white teeth teens are out -out-
white teeth teens are out
song over
my blood is a flood of rubies , precious stones
it keeps my veins hot , the fires find a home in me
i move through town , i 'm quiet like a fire
and my necklace is of rope , i tie it and untie it
and our people talk to me , but nothing ever hits
so people talk to me , and all the voices just burn the holes
i 'm going in -whole-
this is the start of how it all ends
they used to shout my name , now they whisper it
red , orange , yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
we rip the start , the colors disappear
i never watch the stars there 's so much down here
red , orange , yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
i dream all year , but they 're not the same kinds
and the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time
and now people talk to me , i 'm slipping out of reach now
people talk to me , and all their faces blur bright , i got my
fingers laced together and i made a little prison gb* and i 'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
i 'm going in -whole-
this is the start of how it all ends
they used to shout my name , now they whisper it
red , orange , yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
we rip the start , the colors disappear
i never watch the stars there 's so much down here
red , orange , yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart , oh oh oh
and this is the red , orange , yellow flicker beat
sparking up my heart , oh oh oh
and this is the red , orange , yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat , mmmm
song over
i was walking through icy streams that took my breath away
moving slowly through westward water , over glacial plains
and i walked off you
and i walked off an old me
oh me , oh my , i thought it was a dream
so it seemed
and now , breathe deep , i 'm inhaling
leave me be , i 'm exhaling
wooh oooh oooh oooh
oooh oooh you and i , there 's air in between
wooh oooh oooh oooh
oooh oooh
cut my hair so i could rock back and forth
without thinking of you
learn to talk and say whatever i wanted to
and i walked off you
and i walked off an old me
oh me , oh my , i thought it was a dream
and now , breathe deep , i 'm inhaling
leave me be , i 'm exhaling
wooh oooh oooh oooh
oooh oooh
wooh oooh oooh oooh
oooh oooh
wooh oooh oooh oooh
oooh oooh you and i , there 's air in between
wooh oooh oooh oooh
oooh oooh you and i , there 's air in between
song over
sometimes i lay under the moon , i thank god i 'm breathing
then i pray do n't take me soon , 'cause i am here for reason
sometimes in my tears i drown , but i never let it get me down
so when negativity surrounds , i know someday it 'll all turn around because
all my life i 've been waiting for ,
i 've been praying for , for the people to say
that we do n't wan na fight no more ,
there 'll be no more wars , and our children will play
one day , one day , one day , oh oh oh
one day , one day , one day , oh oh oh
it 's not about win or lose , 'cause we all lose when they feed on the
souls of the innocent , blood-drenched pavement ,
keep on movin ' though the waters stay ragin '
in this maze you could lose your way , your way
it might drive you crazy , but do n't let it phase you no way , no way
sometimes in my tears i drown , but i never let it get me down
so when negativity surrounds , i know someday it 'll all turn around because
all my life i 've been waiting for ,
i 've been praying for , for the people to say
that we do n't wan na fight no more ,
there 'll be no more wars , and our children will play
one day , one day , one day , oh oh oh
one day , one day , one day , oh oh oh
one day this all will change , treat people the same ,
stop with the violence , down with the hate
one day we 'll all be free , and proud to be
under the same sun singing songs of freedom like
wye oh wye oh oh oh
wye oh wye oh oh oh
all my life i 've been waiting for ,
i 've been praying for , for the people to say
that we do n't wan na fight no more ,
there 'll be no more wars , and our children will play
one day , one day , one day , oh oh oh
one day , one day , one day , oh oh oh
song over
i was up in my head
for everything i said
quarter million words
they 're all made with lead
i bought a megaphone
to use inside your home
forgot the batteries
but that 's the old me
shouting out of my windows
rolled down
cuz i do n't care anymore
said i do n't care
ooooooooooh ooooooh ooooooh
ooooooooooh ooooooh ooooooh
ooooooooooh ooooooh ooooooh
ooooooooooh ooooooh ooooooh
i 'm standing on the top
of a parking lot
i gave it all i had
show me what you got
shouting out of my windows
rolled down
cuz i do n't care anymore
said i do n't care
ooooooooooh ooooooh ooooooh
ooooooooooh ooooooh ooooooh

song over
there 's a ghost in my bedroom , it haunts me at night
i 've asked him to leave , but he keeps stopping by
just when i think that i 'm alone
it shows up again with a friend this time
and now this is getting old
i do n't know what to do
metaphorically , this ghost is you .
now this ghost in my bedroom he gives me advice
he promised one day that he 'd teach me to fight
now when i think that i 'm alone
he comes up my way with a devil smile
singing this is now my home
you 're my wish come true
when you reach that golden cloud i 'll be there with you
if there were monsters in the closet
well i do n't think i would be surprised
i hear them call out from my window
they try and trick me to come outside
we talked all day
i ca n't tell if he 's real or a made up version of her again
never alone , because i 've got you
get this out of my head
no i wo n't waste away my love
on to something new
if there 's only one way out
i 'll come back for you
if i get stuck out there forever
tell everyone that i said goodbye
you 're on my lifelong list of wishes
if i could bring you back
we do n't belong here now
if he stays well that just means i 've got numbered days
til i go back to my little world
where it 's just me and my imaginary friends
so go out and love
find a new direction
do n't get stuck on your way
the other side 's a scary place
do your best not to be afraid
lose it all when we run away
letting go of the little things you know i do
there 's a ghost in my bedroom
and he 's dying to meet you
god knows he 's heard all about you
i guess he 's friendly enough
though i 've seen him lie
he 's seeking roses in your bed
says he wo n't let you down
there 's a ghost in my bedroom
slowly slowly how could i go down
i want you to notice when i let go
slowly slowly how could i go down ?
i want you to notice when i let go
song over

song over
you were a child
crawling on your knees toward him
making momma so proud
but your voice is too loud
we like to watch you laughing
picking insects off of plants
no time to think of consequences
control yourself
take only what you need from it
control yourself
take only what you need from it
crying out for attention memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror decisions too decisions are made and not bought but i thought this would n't hurt a lot i guess not
control yourself
take only what you need from it
control yourself
take only what you need from it
control yourself
take only what you need from it
control yourself
take only what you need from it
control yourself
take only what you need from it
control yourself
take only what you need from it
song over
i want you by my side
so that i never feel alone again
they 've always been so kind
but now they 've brought you away from here
i hope they did n't get your mind
your heart is too strong anyway
we need to fetch back the time
they have stolen from us
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you 've never danced like this before
but we do n't talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
should n't talk about it
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you 've never danced like this before
but we do n't talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
coldest winter for me
no sun is shining anymore
the only thing i feel is pain
caused by absence of you
suspence is controlling my mind
i can not find the way out of here
i want you by my side
so that i never feel alone again
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you 've never danced like this before
but we do n't talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
should n't talk about it
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you 've never danced like this before
but we do n't talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
and i want you
we can bring it on the floor
you 've never danced like this before
but we do n't talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
should n't talk about it

we can bring it on the floor
you 've never danced like this before
but we do n't talk about it
dancin on doin the boogie all night long
stoned in paradise
song over
you did n't close the door
left a crack open
i could n't ignore the faint possibility
of having hope in this insanity
that we still could be
but we 're stuck floating in between
put me on the shelf ; discipline myself
to let the sparks die out
shattering anything
that has reflections of
you
you
our eyes were closed , with hearts open wide
dismissed every rule to abide by
our bodies undressed the layers of shy
revealing the truth that was buried inside
filled up feelings
that now are bursting at the seams
put me on the shelf ; discipline myself
to let the sparks die out
shattering anything
that has reflections of
you
you
unsure of what are my dreams it seems you have
stolen my slumber and awakened another
life within me that is better than any other
reaching endless heights in never ending nights
that ca n't be seen ; put to bed this dream
oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh
put me on the shelf ; discipline myself
to let the sparks die out
shattering anything
that has reflections of
you
you
song over
i , i ca n't get these memories out of my mind
and some kind of madness has started to evolve
i , i tried so hard to let you go
but some kind of madness is swallowing me whole , yeah
i have finally seen the light
and i have finally realised what you mean
and now i need to know is this real love
or is it just madness keeping us afloat ?
and when i look back at all the crazy fights we 've had
it 's like some kind of madness was taking control , yeah
and now i have finally seen the light
and i have finally realised what you need
and now i have finally seen the end
and i 'm not expecting you to care , no
and i have finally seen the light
and i have finally realized
i need to love
i need to love
come to me , just in a dream
come on and rescue me
yes i know i can be wrong
maybe i 'm too headstrong
madness
song over
you wo n't get much closer
until you sacrifice it all
you wo n't get to taste it
with your face against the wall
show the power trapped within
do just what you want to
now stand up and begin
ooh , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 fire 's in your eyes
and this chaos it defies imagination
ooh , , 6 , 7 , 8 minus 9 lives
you 've arrived at panic station
doubts will try to break you
unleash your heart and soul
trouble will surround you
start taking some control
stand up and deliver
your wildest fantasy
do what the xxxx you want to
there 's no one to appease
ooh , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 fire 's in your eyes
and this chaos it defies imagination
ooh , , 6 , 7 , 8 minus 9 lives
you 've arrived at panic station
ooh , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 fire 's in your eyes
and this chaos it defies imagination
ooh , , 6 , 7 , 8 minus 9 lives
and i know you will fight for the duration
ooh , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 fire 's in your eyes
and you know i 'm not resisting your temptations
ooh , , 6 , 7 , 8 minus 9 lives
you 've arrived at panic station
song over
is your secret safe tonight ?
and are we out of sight ?
or will our world come tumbling down ?
will they find our hiding place ?
is this our last embrace ?
or will the walls start caving in ?
- it could be wrong , could be wrong - but it should 've been right
- it could be wrong , could be wrong - let our hearts ignite
- it could be wrong , could be wrong - are we digging a hole ?
- it could be wrong , could be wrong - it could never last
- it could be wrong , could be wrong - left to raise it fast
- it could be wrong , could be wrong - but it could 've been right
love is our resistance
they keep us apart and they wo n't stop breaking us down
and hold me , our lips must always be sealed
if we live our life in fear
i 'll wait a thousand years
just to see you smile again
quell your prayers for love and peace
you 'll wake the thought police
we can hide the truth inside
- it could be wrong , could be wrong - but it should 've been right
- it could be wrong , could be wrong - let our hearts ignite
- it could be wrong , could be wrong - are we digging a hole ?
- it could be wrong , could be wrong - it could never last
- it could be wrong , could be wrong - left to raise it fast
- it could be wrong , could be wrong - but it could 've been right
love is our resistance
they keep us apart and they wo n't stop breaking us down
and hold me , our lips must always be sealed
the night has reached its end
we ca n't pretend
we must run
we must run
it 's time to run
take us away from here
protect us from further harm
resistance !
song over
wake to see - your true emancipation is a fantasy .
policies have risen up and overcome the brave .
greatness dies , unsung and lost , invisible to history .
embedded spies brainwashing our children to be mean .
you do n't have long ,
i am on to you
the time , it has come to destroy ...
ooooooooooooooooooh
you do n't have long ,
i am on to you
the time , it has come to destroy ...

i know you 've suffered
but i do n't want you to hide
it 's cold and loveless
i wo n't let you be denied
soothing
i 'll make you feel pure
and trust me
you can be sure
i want to reconcile the violence in your heart
i want to recognize your beauty 's not just a mask
i want to exorcise the demons from your past
i want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart
that you 're wicked and divine
you may be a sinner
but your innocence is mine
please me
show me how it 's done
tease me
you are the one
i want to reconcile the violence in your heart
i want to recognize your beauty 's not just a mask
i want to exorcise the demons from your past
i want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart
please me
show me how it 's done
trust me
you are the one
i want to reconcile the violence in your heart
i want to recognize your beauty 's not just a mask
i want to exorcise the demons from your past
i want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart

the paranoia is in bloom , the pr
the transmissions will resume
they 'll try to push drugs
we will never see the truth around , so come on
another promise , another scene , another
with all the green belts wrapped around our minds
and endless red tape to keep the truth confined , so come on
they will not force us
they will stop degrading us
they will not control us
we will be victorious , so come on
interchanging mind control
come let the revolution take it 's toll if you could
flick the switch and open your third eye , you 'd see that
we should never be afraid to die , so come on
rise up and take the power back , it 's time that
the fat cats had a heart attack , you know that
their time is coming to an end
we have to unify and watch our flag ascend , so come on
they will not force us
they will stop degrading us
they will not control us
we will be victorious , so come on
hey ! hey !
hey ! hey !
hey ! hey !
hey ! hey !
hey ! hey !

they will not force us
they will stop degrading us
they will not control us
we will be victorious , so come on

after you
run away
like it was yesterday
and we could run away
if we could run away
run away from here .
i 've got a bulletproof heart
you 've got a hollow-point smile
me and your runaway scars
got a photograph dream
on the getaway mile
let 's blow a hole in this town !
and do our talking with a laser beam
gunning out of this place
in a bullet 's embrace
then we 'll do it again .
how can they say
`` jenny could you come back home ? ''
'cause everybody knows you do n't
ever wan na come back
let me be the one to save you

because i sure do n't like the company

'cause i really do n't care
and i 'll do it again
so get me out of my head
'cause it 's getting kind of cramped , you know
coming ready or not
when the motor gets hot
we can do it again
the papers say
`` johnny wo n't you come back home ? ''
'cause everybody knows you do n't
want to give yourself up
tell the truth and god will save you !

and though i know
how much you hate this
are you gon na be
the one to save us
from the black
and hopeless feeling ?
will you mean it
when the end comes reeling ?
hold your heart
into this darkness
will it ever be the light
to shine you out
or fail and leave you stranded ?
i ai n't gon na be
the one left standing
you ai n't gon na be
the one left standing
we ai n't gon na be
the ones left standing
gravity
do n't mean too much to me

some people watch , some people pray
but even lights can fade away
some people hope , some people pay
but why we have to stay
cause even here , we 're scared to bruise
or any misery you choose
you like to watch , we like to use
and we were born to lose
i choose defeat , i walk away
and leave this place for sane today
some like to sleep , we like to play
just look at all that pain
you want the heart and to be saved
but even good guys still get paid
so watch your back and keep the blade
i think it got you laid
so fake your death , oh it 's your blame
and leave the lights on when you stay
take off your clothes and dream and fade
come on and feel that shame
i choose defeat , i walk away
and leave this place for sane today
we like to sleep , we like to play
just look at all that pain
just look at all that pain
just look at all that pain
just look at all that pain
just give me all that pain
just give me all that pain

lost in skies of powdered gold
caught in clouds of silver ropes
showered by the empty hopes
as i tumble down falling fast to the ground
i know i 'll wither
so peel away the bark
grows when it is dark
in spite of all my fears
i can see it all so clear
wohoo
cover your crystal eyes
and feel the tones that tremble down your spine
wohoo
cover your crystal eyes
and let your colours bleed and blend with mine
making ways in pitch black sand
feel the salt dance on my hands
raw and charcoal coloured thighs
feel so cold and my skin feels so paper-thin
i know i 'll wither
so peel away the bark
grows when it is dark
in spite of all my fears
i can see it all so clear
wohoo
cover your crystal eyes
and feel the tones that tremble down your spine
wohoo
cover your crystal eyes
and let your colours bleed and blend with mine
but i 'm ok in see-through skin
i forgive what is within
because i 'm in this house , i 'm in this home
all my time
wohoo
cover your crystal eyes
and feel the tones that tremble down your spine
wohoo
cover your crystal eyes
and let your colours bleed and blend with mine
song over
jumping up and down the floor
my head is an animal
and once there was an animal
it had a son that mowed the lawn
the son was an ok guy
thay had a pet dragonfly
the dragonfly it ran away
but it came back with a story to say
hey !
hey !
her dirty paws and furry coat
she ran down the forest slope
the forest of talking trees
they used to sing about the birds and the bees
the bees had declared a war
the sky was n't be enough for them all
the birds they got help from below
from dirty paws and the creatures of snow
hey !
hey !
and for a while things were cold
they were scared down in their holes
the forest that once was green
was colored black by those killing machines
but she and her furry friends
took down the queen bee and her men
and that 's how the story goes
the story of the beast with those four dirty paws
hey !
hey !
hey !
song over
hey !
hey !
hey !
i do n't like walking around this old and empty house
so hold my hand , i 'll walk with you my dear
the stairs creak as i sleep , it 's keeping me awake
it 's the house telling you to close your eyes
some days i ca n't even trust myself
it 's killing me to see you this way
'cause though the truth may vary
this ship will carry
our bodies safe to shore
hey !
hey !
hey !
there 's an old voice in my head that 's holding me back
tell her that i miss our little talks
soon it will be over and buried with our past
we used to play outside when we were young - and full of life and full of love -
some days i do n't know if i am wrong or right
your mind is playing tricks on you my dear
'cause though the truth may vary
this ship will carry
our bodies safe to shore hey !
do n't listen to a word i say . hey !
the screams all sound the same . hey !
'cause though the truth may vary
this ship will carry
our bodies safe to shore
you 're gone , gone , gone away . i watched you disappear
all that 's left is a ghost of you
now we 're torn , torn , torn apart , there 's nothing we can do .
just let me go , we 'll meet again soon .
now wait , wait , wait for me . please hang around
i see you when i fall asleep . hey !
do n't listen to a word i say . hey !
the screams all sound the same . hey !
'cause though the truth may vary
this ship will carry
our bodies safe to shore
'cause though the truth may vary
this ship will carry
our bodies safe to shore
song over
i heard them calling in the distance
so i packed my things and ran
far away from all the trouble
i had caused with my two hands
alone we traveled on with nothing but a shadow
we fled far away
hold your horses now - we sleep until the sun goes down -
through the woods we ran - deep in to the mountain sound -
hold your horses now - we sleep until the sun goes down -
through the woods we ran
some hid scars and some hid scratches
it made me wonder about their past
and as i looked around i began to notice
that we were nothing like the rest
hold your horses now - we sleep until the sun goes down -
through the woods we ran - deep in to the mountain sound -
hold your horses now - we sleep until the sun goes down -
through the woods we ran
wooooah - we sleep until the sun goes down -
wooooah - we sleep until the sun goes down -
wooooah - we sleep until the sun goes down -
hold your horses now - we sleep until the sun goes down -
through the woods we ran - deep in to the mountain sound -
hold your horses now - we sleep until the sun goes down -
through the woods we ran
hold your horses now - we sleep until the sun goes down -
through the woods we ran - deep in to the mountain sound -
hold your horses now - we sleep until the sun goes down -
through the woods we ran

song over
it 's hard letting go
i 'm finally at peace but it feels wrong
slowed , i 'm getting up
my hands and feet are weaker than before
and you are folded on the bed
where i rest my head
there 's nothing i can see
darkness becomes me
but i 'm already there
i 'm already there
wherever there is you
i will be there too
there 's nothing that i 'd take back
but it 's hard to say there 's nothing i regret
cause when i sing , you shout
i breathe out loud , you bleed
but when it 's over , i 'm still away
no matter where i sleep you are haunting me
but i 'm already there , i 'm already there
wherever there is you , i will be there too
but i 'm already there , i 'm already there
wherever there is you , i will be there too .
cause i 'm already there , i 'm already there
wherever there is you , i will be there too
i 'm already there , i 'm already there
wherever there is you , i will be there too .

you would not believe your eyes
if ten million fireflies
lit up the world as i fell asleep
'cause they 'd fill the open air
and leave teardrops everywhere
you 'd think me rude but i would just stand and stare
i 'd like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
it 's hard to say that i 'd rather stay awake when i 'm asleep
'cause everything is never as it seems
'cause i 'd get a thousand hugs
from ten thousand lightning bugs
as they tried to teach me how to dance
a foxtrot above my head
a sock hop beneath my bed
a disco ball is just hanging by a thread
i 'd like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
it 's hard to say that i 'd rather stay awake when i 'm asleep
'cause everything is never as it seems when i fall asleep
leave my door open just a crack - please take me away from here -
'cause i feel like such an insomniac - please take me away from here -
why do i tire of counting sheep - please take me away from here -
when i 'm far too tired to fall asleep
to ten million fireflies
i 'm weird 'cause i hate goodbyes
i got misty eyes as they said farewell
but i 'll know where several are
if my dreams get real bizarre
'cause i saved a few and i keep them in a jar
i 'd like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
it 's hard to say that i 'd rather stay awake when i 'm asleep
'cause everything is never as it seems when i fall asleep
i 'd like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
it 's hard to say that i 'd rather stay awake when i 'm asleep
'cause everything is never as it seems when i fall asleep
i 'd like to make myself believe
that planet earth turns slowly
it 's hard to say that i 'd rather stay awake when i 'm asleep
because my dreams are bursting at the seams

song over
there is not a single word
in the whole world
that could describe the hurt
the dullest knife just sawing back and forth
ripping through the softest skin there ever was
how were you to know ?
how were you to know ?
and i , i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but i 've been there before
and i , i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but i 've been there before
love happens all the time
to people who are n't kind
and heroes who are blind
expecting perfect scripted movie scenes
who wants an awkward silence mystery ?
how were you to know ?
how were you to know ?
and i , i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but i 've been there before
and i , i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but i 've been there before
for all the air that 's in your lungs
for all the joy that is to come
for all the things that you 're alive to feel
just let the pain remind you hearts can heal
how were you to know ?
how were you to know ?
and i , i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but i 've been there before
and i , i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but i 've been there before

if i 'm a bad person you do n't like me i guess i 'll make my own way
it 's a circle a mean cycle
i ca n't excite you anymore
where 's your gavel ? your jury ? what 's my offense this time ?
you 're not a judge but if you 're gon na judge me
well sentence me to another life
do n't wan na hear your sad songs i do n't wan na feel your pain when you swear it 's all my fault cause you know we 're not the
same we 're not the same
oh we 're not the same
the friends who stuck together we wrote our names in blood but i guess you ca n't accept
that the change is good
it 's good it 's good it 's good
you treat me just like
another stranger
well it 's nice to meet
you sir i guess i 'll go
i best be on my way out - repeat -
ignorance is your new best friend ignorance is your new best friend
this is the best thing that could 've happened any longer and i would n't have made it
it 's not a war no it 's not a rapture
i 'm just a person but you ca n't take it
the same tricks that once fooled me they wo n't get you anywhere
i 'm not the same kid from your memory
now i can fend for myself

feels like i 'm waken from the dead
been waiting on me
least now i 'll never have to wonder
sleep a year away
but were we indestructible i thought that we
could brave it all -all-
i never thought that what would take me out
was hiding down below
lost the battle
win the war
i 'm bringing mysinking ship back
to the shore
we 're starting over
or head back in
there 's a time and a place
to die but this ai n't it

now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
wish i could find a crystal ball
completely worthless
you know i 'd use it all for good
i would not take it for granted -granted-
instead , i 'd have some memories
feel anything
at least they would remind me
same mistakes again
lost the battle

well you only need the light when it s burning low
only miss the sun when it s starts to snow
only know your lover when you let her go
only know you ve been high when you re feeling low
only hate the road when you re missin home
only know your lover when you ve let her go
and you let her go
staring at the bottom of your glass
hoping one day you will make a dream last
the dreams come slow and goes so fast
you see her when you close your eyes
maybe one day you will understand why
everything you touch all it dies
because you only need the light when it s burning low
only miss the sun when it s starts to snow
only know your lover when you let her go
only know you ve been high when you re feeling low
only hate the road when you re missin home
only know your lover when you ve let her go
staring at the ceiling in the dark
same old empty feeling in your heart
love comes slow and it goes so fast
well you see her when you fall asleep
but to never to touch and never to keep
because you loved her to much
and you dive too deep
because you only need the light when it s burning low
only miss the sun when it s starts to snow
only know your lover when you let her go
only know you ’ ve been high when you re feeling low
only hate the road when you re missin home
only know your lover when you ve let her go
and you let her go
ooooo ooooo oooooo
and you let her go
ooooooo ooooo ooooo
and you let her go
because you only need the light when it s burning low
only miss the sun when it s starts to snow
only know your lover when you let her go
only know you ve been high when you re feeling low
only hate the road when you re missin home
only know your lover when you ve let her go
and you let her go
because you only need the light when it s burning low
only miss the sun when it s starts to snow
only know your lover when you let her go
only know you ’ ve been high when you re feeling low
only hate the road when you re missin home
only know your lover when you ve let her go

well sing , sing at the top of your voice .
love , without fear in your heart
feel , feel like you still have a choice .
if we all light up we can scare away the dark !
wish our week days away , spend our weekends in bed
we drink ourselves stupid and work ourselves dead
and all just because that 's what mom and dad said we should do
we should run through the forests , we should swim in the streams
we should laugh we should cry , we should love we should dream
we should stare at the stars , and not just a screen
you should hear what i 'm saying and know what it means to sing , ...
... sing at the top of your voice .
love , without fear in your heart
feel , feel like you still have a choice .
if we all light up we can scare away the dark !
yeah we wish we were happier , thinner and fitter
we wish we were n't losers and liars and quitters ,
we want something more not just nasty and bitter
we want something real , not just hashtags and twitter
it 's the meaning of life . and it 's streams live on youtube
but i bet gangnam style will still get more views
and we 're scared of drowning , and flying and shooters
but we 're all slowing dying in front of xxxxing computers
so sing , sing at the top of your voice .
love , without fear in your heart
can you feel , feel like you still have a choice ?
if we all light up we can scare away the dark !
and oh , ooh-ooh-ooh , oh-oh-oh o-oh ooh-no x6
well sing , sing at the top of your voice .
love , without fear in your heart
feel , feel like you still have a choice .
if we all light up we can scare away the dark !
song over
all these kinds of places
make it seem like it 's been ages
tommorrow some new building will scrape the sky
i love this country dearly
i can feel the ladder clearly
but i never thought i 'd be alone to try
once i was outside penn station
selling red and white carnations
we were still alone , my wife and i
before we marry , save my money
brought my dear wife over
now i want to bring my family state side
but off the boat they sail a while
then scatter cross the course
once a year i 'll see them for a week or so at most
i took a walk
practice is n't perfect
with the market cuts and loss
i remind myself that times could be much worse
my wife wo n't ask me questions
it was not so much to ask
and she 'll never flaunt around an empty purse
once my mother-in-law came
just to stay a couple nights
then decided she will stay the rest of her life
i watch my little children , play some board game in the kitchen
and i sit and pray they never feel my strife .
but then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
he made some bad investments
now the counts are overdrawn
i took a walk
honey it 's this loan i think i borrowed just too much
we had taxes we had bills
we had a lifestyle of fun
and tonight i swear i 'll come home
and we 'll make love like we 're young
and tomorrow you 'll cook dinner
for the neighbors and the kids
we can rip apart those socialists
and all their damn taxes
you 'll see i am no criminal
i 'm down on both bad knees
i 'm just too much a coward
to admit when i 'm in need
i took a walk
song over
yes , i understand that every life must end , uh-huh
as we sit alone , i know someday we must go , uh-huh
oh i 'm a lucky man , to count on both hands the ones i love
some folks just have one , yeah , others they 've got none , uh-huh
stay with me ...
lets just breathe ...
practiced all my sins , never gon na let me win , uh-huh
under everything , just another human being , uh-huh
i do n't wan na hurt , there 's so much in this world to make me believe
stay with me
you 're all i see ...
did i say that i need you ?
did i say that i want you ?
oh , if i did n't , i 'm a fool you see
no one knows this more than me
as i come clean ...
i wonder everyday , as i look upon your face , uh-huh
everything you gave and nothing you would take , oh no
nothing you would take , everything you gave ...
did i say that i need you ?
oh , did i say that i want you ?
oh , if i did n't , i 'm a fool you see
no one knows this more than me
and i come clean , ah ...
nothing you would take , everything you gave
hold me 'till i die
meet you on the other side ...

i 'll shut down the city lights
to make you well , to make you well
when enemies are at your door

to make you well , to make you well
give me reasons to believe
that you would do the same for me

i love you long after you 're gone

i 've paid my dues , time after time .
i 've done my sentence , but committed no crime .
and bad mi-stakes , i 've made a few .
i 've had my share of sand kicked in my face , but i 've come through .
and we mean to go on , and on , and on , and on .
we are the champions , my friends .
and we 'll keep on fighting 'till the end .
we are the champions , we are the cham-pions .
no time for losers , 'cos we are the champions ,
of the world .
i 've taken my bows , and my curtain calls .
you brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it ;
i thank you all .
but it 's been no bed of roses , no pleasure cruise .
i consider it a challenge before the whole human race and i ai n't gon na lose .
and we mean to go on , and on , and on , and on .

song over
it kills me not to know this but i 've all but just forgotten
what the color of her eyes were
and her scars or how she got them
as the telling signs of age rain down a single tear is dropping
through the valleys of an aging face that this world has forgotten
there is no reconciliation that will put me in my place
and there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds
but seldom do these words ring true when i 'm constantly failing you
like walls that we just ca n't break through until we disappear
so tell me now
if this ai n't love then how do we get out ?
cause ' i do n't know
that 's when she said i do n't hate you boy
i just want to save you while there 's still something left to save
that 's when i told her i love you girl
but i 'm not the answer for the questions that you still have
whoa whoa
but the day pressed on like crushing weights
for no man does it ever wait
like memories of dying days
that deafen us like hurricanes
bathed in flames we held the brand
uncurled the fingers in your hand
pressed into the flesh like sand
now do you understand ?
so tell me now
if this ai n't love then how do we get out ?
cause ' i do n't know
that 's when she said i do n't hate you boy
i just want to save you while there 's still something left to save
that 's when i told her i love you girl
but i 'm not the answer for the questions that you still have
whoa whoa
1000 miles away
there 's nothing left to say
but so much left that i do n't know
we never had a choice
this world is too much noise
it takes me under
it takes me under once again
i do n't hate you
i do n't hate you no
so tell me now
if this ai n't love then how do we get out ?
cause ' i do n't know
that 's when she said i do n't hate you boy
i just want to save you while there 's still something left to save
that 's when i told her i love you girl
but i 'm not the answer for the questions that you still have
i do n't hate you
i do n't hate you , no

i 'm at war with the world and they
try to pull me in the dark
i struggle to find my faith
as i 'm slippin ' from your arms
it 's getting harder to stay awake
and my strength is fading fast
you breathe into me at last
i 'm awake ! i 'm alive !
now i know what i believe inside
now it 's my time
i 'll do what i want 'cause this is my life
here -right here- , right now -right now- !
i 'll stand my ground and never back down
i know what i believe inside
i 'm awake and i 'm alive !
i 'm at war with the word 'cause i
ai n't never gon na sell my soul
i 've already made up my mind
no matter what i ca n't be bought or sold
and i feel like giving in
you breathe into me again
i 'm awake ! i 'm alive !
now i know what i believe inside
now it 's my time
i 'll do what i want 'cause this is my life
here -right here- , right now -right now- !
i 'll stand my ground and never back down
i know what i believe inside
i 'm awake and i 'm alive !
waking up waking up , waking up waking up
waking up waking up , waking up waking up
in the dark , i can feel you in my sleep
in your arms i feel you breathe into me
forever hold this heart that i will give to you
forever i will live for you !
i 'm awake ! i 'm alive !
now i know what i believe inside
now it 's my time
i 'll do what i want 'cause this is my life

waking up waking up . waking up waking up .
song over
bury all your secrets in my skin
come away with innocence , and leave me with my sins
the air around me still feels like a cage
and love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again…
so if you love me , let me go . and run away before i know .
my heart is just too dark to care . i ca n't destroy what is n't there .
deliver me into my fate - if i 'm alone i can not hate
i do n't deserve to have you…
my smile was taken long ago / if i can change i hope i never know
i still press your letters to my lips
and cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
i could n't face a life without your light
but all of that was ripped apart… when you refused to fight
so save your breath , i will not hear . i think i made it very clear .
you could n't hate enough to love . is that supposed to be enough ?
i only wish you were n't my friend . then i could hurt you in the end .
i never claimed to be a saint…
my own was banished long ago / it took the death of hope to let you go
so break yourself against my stones
and spit your pity in my soul
you never needed any help
you sold me out to save yourself
and i wo n't listen to your shame
you ran away - you 're all the same
angels lie to keep control…
my love was punished long ago
if you still care , do n't ever let me know
if you still care , do n't ever let me know…
song over
all i want to get is , a little bit closer .
here comes the breath before we get a little bit closer .
here comes the rush before we touch , come a little closer .
doors are open , wind is really blowing , night sky is changing over and
its not just all physical , im the type that wont get oh so critical .
all you ’ re thinking lately is getting underneath me .
here comes the heat before we meet , a little bit closer .
here comes the spark before the dark , come a little closer .
lights are off and the sun is finally setting , night sky is changing over and
its not just all physical , im the type that wont get oh so critical .
here come the dreams of you and me -x2- here come the dreams -x2-
its not just all physical , im the type that wont get oh so critical .

i like your face despite your nose
17 and a half years old
i 'm worrying about my brother finding out
where 's the fun in doing what you 're told ?
i said `` no !
oh give it a rest , i could persuade you
i 'm not your typical , stoned 18 year old
give me a night i 'll make you .
i know you 're looking for salvation in the secular age ,
but girl i 'm not your saviour ''
wrestle to the ground
god help me now
a pair of frozen hands to hold ,
oh she 's so southern so she feels the cold ,
one moment i was tearing off your blouse ,
now you 're living in my house .
what happened to just messing around ?
i said `` yo , i think i better go ; i ca n't take you .
you just sit and get stoned with 30 year olds and you think you 've made it .
well , should n't you be xxxxing with somebody your age instead of making changes ? ''
wrestle to the ground
god help me now
i told her from the start
destined to be hard
i told her from the start
i 'll break your heart
destined to be hard

so i heard you found somebody else
and at first i thought it was a lie
i took all of my things that make sounds
the rest i can do without
i do n't want your body but i hate to
think about you with somebody else
our love has gone cold , you 're intertwining
your soul with somebody else
i 'm looking through you while you 're looking
through your phone and then leaving with somebody else
oh , i do n't want your body but i 'm
picturing your body with somebody else
come on baby , this ai n't the last time that i 'll see your face
come on baby , you said you 'd find someone to take my place
oh i just do n't believe that you have got
it in you cos we are just gon na keep 'doin it '
and everytime i start to believe in anything
you 're saying i 'm reminded that i should be getting over it
i do n't want your body but i hate to
think about you with somebody else
our love has gone cold , you 're intertwining
your soul with somebody else
i 'm looking through you while you 're looking through
your phone and then leaving with somebody else
oh , i do n't want your body but i 'm

get someone you love ? get someone you need ? xxxx that , get money
i ca n't give you my soul , cos we 're never alone

hey boy , stop pacing around the room
using other people 's faces as a mirror for you
i know your lungs need filling
since your gums have lost their feeling
but do n't say that you 're giving it up again
`` do you have a card ?
my irregular heart beat is starting to correct itself ''
it 's just a simple diuretic that prevents the empathetic
from being just - and giving it up
and you 're the only thing that 's going on in my mind
taking over my life a second time
i do n't have the capacity for xxxxing
you 're meant to be helping me
when i said i liked it better without my money , i lied
it took a little while to recognize
that i , i 'm not giving it up again
this conversation 's not about reciprocation no more
but i 'm gon ' wait until you finish so i can talk some more
about me and my things , my car , my living
and how i 'm giving it up , giving it up again
and you 're the only thing that 's going on in my mind
taking over my life a second time
i do n't have the capacity for xxxxing
you 're meant to be helping me
when i said i liked it better without my money , i lied
it took a little while to recognize
that i , i 'm not giving it up again
oh the kick wo n't last for long
but the song only lasts 3 minutes
i think i 've lost my phone
so wo n't you call it up for me ?
oh the kick wo n't last for long
but the song only lasts 3 minutes
and i know it 's wrong
but give me one
and you 're the only thing that 's going on in my mind
taking over my life a second time
i do n't have the capacity for xxxxing
you 're meant to be helping me
when i said i liked it better without my money , i lied

song over
and it starts sometime around midnight
or at least that ’ s when you lose yourself for a minute or two
as you stand under the bar lights
while the band plays some song , about forgetting yourself for a while
and the piano 's this melancholy soundtrack for her smile
that white dress she 's wearing , you haven ’ t seen her for a while
but you know , that she ’ s watching
she ’ s laughing , she ’ s turning . she ’ s holding her tonic like a cross
the room 's suddenly spinning , as she walks up and asks how you are
so you can smell her perfume , you can see her lying naked in your arms
and so there ’ s a change in your emotions
when all these memories come rushing , like feral waves to your mind
of curl of your bodies , like two perfect circles entwined
so you feel hopeless and homeless , and lost in the haze of the wine
then she leaves with some one you do n't know
but she makes sure you saw her , she looks right at you and bolts
as she walks out the door , your blood boiling , your stomach in ropes
oh and when your friends say , `` what is it you look like you ’ ve seen a ghost ''
then you walk under the streetlights
and you ’ re too drunk to notice , that everyone is staring at you
you just don ’ t care what you look like , the world is falling around you
you just have to see her
you just have to see her
you just have to see her
you just have to see her
you just have to see her

there is a house in new orleans
they call the risin ' sun
and it 's been the ruin of many a poor boy .
and god , i know i 'm one .
my mother was a tailor .
she sewed my new blue jeans .
my father was a gamblin ' man
down in new or-leans .
now , the only thing a gambler needs
is a suitcase and a trunk
and the only time that he 's satis-fied
is when he 's on a drunk
oh , mother , tell your children
not to do what i have done .
spend your lives in sin and misery
in the house of the risin ' sun .
well , i 've got one foot on the platform .
the other foot on the train .
i 'm goin ' back to new orleans
to wear that ball and chain .
well , there is a house in new orleans
they call the risin ' sun
and it 's been the ruin of many a poor boy .
and god , i know i 'm one .

all it will take is just one moment and
you can say goodbye to how we had it planned
fear like a habit run like a rabbit out and away
through the screen door to the unknown
and i want to love you and more
i want to find you and more
where do you reside
when you hide how can i find you
cause i wan na send you and more
i wan na tempt you and more
can you tell that i
am alive , let me prove it .
you and i we 're the same
live and die we 're the same
hear my voice know my name
you and i we 're the same
live like a pharaoh
sing like a sparrow anyway
even if there is no land or love in sight
we bloom like roses lead like moses out and away
through the bitter crowd to the daylight
and i want to love you and more
i want to find you and more
can you tell that i
am alive let me prove it to ya .
you and i we 're the same

song over
when my body wo n't hold me anymore
and it finally lets me free
will i be ready ?
when my feet wo n't walk another mile
and my lips give their last kiss goodbye
will my hands be steady ?
when i lay down my fears
my hopes and my doubts
the rings on my fingers
and the keys to my house
with no hard feelings
when the sun hangs low in the west
and the light in my chest wo n't be kept
held at bay any longer
when the jealousy fades away
and it 's ash and dust for cash and lust
and it 's just hallelujah
and love in thoughts
and love in the words
love in the songs
they sing in the church
and no hard feelings
lord they knows they have n't done
much good for anyone
kept me afraid and cold
with so much to have and hold
when my body wo n't hold me anymore
and it finally lets me free
where will i go ?
will the trade winds take me south
through georgia grain or tropical rain
or snow from the heavens ?
will i join with the ocean blue
or run into the savior true
and shake hands laughing
and walk through the night
straight to the light
holding the love
i 've known in my life
and no hard feelings
lord they knows they have n't done
much good for anyone
kept me afraid and cold
with so much to have and hold
under the curving sky
i 'm finally learning why
it matters for me and you
to say it and mean it too
for life and its loveliness
and all of its ugliness
good as its been to me
i have no enemies
i have no enemies
i have no enemies
i have no enemies

song over
i wanted love , i needed love , most of all , most of all
someone said , true love was dead , and i 'm bound to fall , bound to fall , for you
oh what can i do , yeah
take my badge but my heart remains , lovin ' you , baby child
tighten up , on your reigns , you 're runnin ' wild , runnin ' wild , it 's true
sick for days , so many ways , i 'm achin ' now , i 'm achin ' now
it 's times like these i need relief , please show me how , oh show me how , to get right
yes , out of sight
when i was young , and moving fast , nothing slowed me down , slowed me down
now i let the others pass , i 've come around , oh come around , cause i found
living just to keep going , going just to be sane
all the while i know where , such a shame
i do n't need to get steady i know just how i feel
i 'm telling you to get ready , my dear
song over
it 's not your eyes
it 's not what you say
it 's not your laughter
you 're just lonely
you 've been lonely , too long
oh , you 're acting your thin disguise
all your perfectly delivered lines
they do n't fool me
you 've been lonely , too long
let me in the wall
you 've built around
we can light a match
and burn it down
let me hold your hand
and dance 'round and 'round the flames
in front of us
you 've held your head up
you 've fought the fight
you bear the scars
listen to me
you 've been lonely , too long
let me in the wall
you 've built around
we can light a match
and burn it down
let me hold your hand
and dance 'round and 'round the flames
in front of us
you 're like a mirror , reflecting me
takes one to know one , so take it from me
you 've been lonely
you 've been lonely , too long
we 've been lonely
we 've been lonely , too long
song over
oh , the desert dreams of a river
that will run down to the sea
like my heart longs for an ocean
to wash down over me .
oh , wo n't you take me from this valley
to that mountain high above ?
i will pray , pray , pray
until i see your smiling face .
i will pray , pray , pray
to the one i love .
song over
if you , if you could return
do n't let it burn , do n't let it fade
i 'm sure i 'm not being rude
it 's tearing me apart
and i swore , i swore i would be true
and honey so did you
so why were you holding her hand
were you lying all the time
but i 'm in so deep
you know i 'm such a fool for you
you got me wrapped around your finger
do you have to let it linger
do you have to let it linger
oh , i thought the world of you
i thought nothing could go wrong
but i was wrong
if you , if you could get by
trying not to lie
things would n't be so confused
but you always really knew
and i 'm in so deep
you know i 'm such a fool for you
you got me wrapped around your finger
do you have to let it linger
do you have to let it linger
you know i 'm such a fool for you
you got me wrapped around your finger
do you have to let it linger
do you have to let it linger

song over
wheels are turning
i remember when you were mine
now just to reach you
baby , i 'd stand in line
but there 's another world
we 're living in
tonight
and there 's another heart
that 's fading in
the light
do n't want your picture
on my cell phone
i want you here with me
do n't want your memory
in my head now
i want you here with me
spent the summer
just laying out in the sun
time seems to move so slow
when you 're taking it as it comes
maybe we were just too young
your body was tanned and your hair was long
you showed me your smile and my cares were gone
falling in love filled my soul with fright
you said `` come on babe , it 'll be alright ''
i must have been a fool to the bitter end
now i hold on to hope to have you back again
i 'd bargain and i 'd fight
but there 's another world
we 're living in
tonight
do n't want your picture
on my cell phone
i want you here with me
do n't want your memory
in my head now
i want you here with me
well i saw you in a restaurant
the other day
i ran away
and i 'll keep on waiting for you
till you 'll come around
come around and say
do n't want your picture
on my cell phone
i want you here with me
do n't need those memorys
in my head now
i want you here with me
ooooh !
here with me
ooooh !
ooooh !
here with me
song over
step out into the indian dust
i can feel the cracks in my spirit
they 're starting to bust
drive by your house
nobody 's home
i 'm trying to tell myself that i 'm better off alone
all my friends say i should move on
she 's just another girl
do n't let her stick it to your heart so hard
and all my friends say it was n't meant to be
and it 's a great big world
she 's just another girl
-another girl-
i went to see a fortuneteller , that was a trip
maybe this confusion 's got me losing my grip
i ca n't believe you 're out there flying with someone else uh-huh
now jason 's getting married in the blink of an eye
i got an invitation but i did n't reply
tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
and give him all of my love
all my friends say i should move on
she 's just another girl
do n't let her stick it to your heart so hard
and all my friends say it was n't meant to be
and it 's a great big world
she 's just another girl
i could be reeling them in left and right
something 's got a hold on me , tonight
well maybe all of my friends should confront
the fact that i do n't want another girl
all of my friends say i should move on
all of my friends say
all of my friends say
all of my friends say
she 's just another girl
then why ca n't i sleep at night
and why do n't the moon look right
the sound 's off but the tv 's on
and it 's a great big world
she 's just another girl ,
do n't let her stick it to your heart boys
she 's just another girl
all my friends say she 's just another girl
another girl
song over
blonde hair blowing in the summer wind
blue eyed girl playing in the sand
i 've been on the trail for a little while
but that was the night that she broke down and held my hand
teenage rush
she said
ai n't we all just runaways ?
we got time and that ai n't much
we ca n't wait 'till tomorrow
you got ta know that this is real
baby , why you wan na fight it ?
it 's the one thing you ca n't choose
oh !
we got engaged on a friday night
i swore on the head of our unborn child
that i could take care of the three of us
but i 've got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild
it 's in my blood
you said she might just runaway
somewhere else , someplace good
we ca n't wait 'till tomorrow
you got ta know that this is real
baby , why you wan na fight it ?
it 's the one thing you ca n't choose
let 's take a chance , baby we ca n't lose
ai n't we all just runaways ?
i knew it when i met you
i 'm not gon na let you runaway
i knew it when i held you
i was n't letting go
we used to look at the stars and confess our dreams
hold each other 'till the morning light
we used to laugh , now we only fight
baby are you lonesome now ?
at night i come home after they go to sleep
like a stumbling ghost i haunt this hall
there 's a picture of us on our wedding day
i recognize the girl but i ca n't settle in these walls
we ca n't wait 'till tomorrow
no we 're caught up in the appeal
baby , why you wan na hide it ?
it 's the last thing on my mind - why you wan na hide it ? -
i turn the engine over and my body just comes alive
ai n't we all just runaways ?
i knew it when i met you
i 'm not gon na let you runaway
i knew it when i held you
i was n't letting go
ai n't we all just runaways ?
yeeeaah , runaways - ai n't we all just runaways ? -
yeeeaah
song over
once in a lifetime
the suffering of fools
to find our way home
to break in these palms
once in a lifetime -once in a lifetime-
once in a lifetime
give me a shot at the night
give me a moment , some kinda mysterious
give me a shot at the night
give me a moment , some kinda mysterious
once in a lifetime
the breaking of the roof
to find that our home
has long been out grown
draw me a life line
'cause honey i got nothing to lose
once in a lifetime -once in a lifetime-
once in a lifetime
give me a shot at the night
give me a moment , some kinda mysterious
give me a shot at the night
give me a moment , some kinda mysterious
give me a shot at the night
look at my reflection in the mirror
underneath the power of the light
give me a shot at the night
give me a shot at the night
give me a shot at the night
i feel like i 'm losing the fight
give me a shot at the night , some kind of mysterious
give me a shot at the night
give me a shot at the night
give me a moment , some kinda mysterious
give me a shot at the night
give me a moment , some kinda mysterious
give me a shot at the night
give me a moment , some kinda mysterious

song over
when you left this town , with your windows down
and the wilderness inside
let the exits pass , all the tar and glass
'til the road and sky align
the strangers in this town ,
they raise you up just to cut you down
oh angela it 's a long time coming
and your volvo lights lit up green and white
with the cities on the signs
but you held your course to some distant war
in the corners of your mind
from the second time around
the only love i ever found
oh angela it 's a long time coming
home at laaaaaast
were you safe and warm in your coat of arms
with your fingers in a fist
did you hear the notes , all those static codes
in the radio abyss ?
strangers in this town ,
they raise you up just to cut you down
oh angela it 's a long time coming
oh angela spent your whole life running away
home at laaaaaast
home at laaaaaast
vacancy , hotel room , lost in me , lost in you
angela , on my knees , i belong , i believe
home at laaaaaast
home at laaaaaast
home at laaaaaast
home at laaaaaast
homea at last
mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm
mmmmmm mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm

flags on antennaes designed to keep me safe , keep me safe

in uniform you raised a man , who vol-un-teered to stand

make your mothers proud
raise your rifles to the sky boys
fire that volley loud
news was bad on upland ave , my touch and mourn our loss
sons rebelled , while fathers yelled ,
and moth-ers clutched the cross
ooooh-oo-oooooh-oo-ooooh-oo-ooooh
play the bugle , play the taps and
make your mothers proud
raise your rifles to the sky boys
fire that volley loud
song over
welllll , she was standing in the bar
i said , `` hello , how do you do ? ''
she handed me a beer with a kangaroo
she spoke of places i had never been
that she had traveled to
and we slowed danced along to faster tunes
i made her laugh , i made a pass , i showed her my half dollar ring
she said , `` that 's pretty cool ,
but classy girls do n't kiss in bars , you fool ''
so later on the crowd calmed down
and i believe it was as if
something drew me closer to her lips
so picture my surprise when i had tried to lean in for a kiss
and she just smiled and turned her head down
i asked her , `` why ? '' and she replied ,
`` it was nothing i was doing wrong , its just what it is ''
no , classy girls do n't kiss in bars like this
no , classy girls do n't kiss in bars
boys will break their backs and hearts
but its alright , the hardest part is through
oh it 's through
oh it 's through
oh it 's through
the hardest part is through .
song over
i was cleopatra , i was young and an actress
when you knelt by my mattress , and asked for my hand
but i was sad you asked it , as i laid in a black dress
with my father in a casket , i had no plans
and i left the footprints , the mud stained on the carpet
and it hardened like my heart did when you left town
but i must admit it , that i would marry you in an instant
damn your wife , i 'd be your mistress just to have you around
but i was late for this , late for that , late for the love of my life
and when i die alone , when i die alone , when i die i 'll be on time
while the church discouraged , any lust that burned within me
yes my flesh , it was my currency , but i held true
so i drive a taxi , and the traffic distracts me
from the strangers in my backseat , they remind me of you
but i was late for this , late for that , late for the love of my life
and when i die alone , when i die alone , when i die i 'll be on time
and the only gifts from my lord were a birth and a divorce
but i 've read this script and the costume fits , so i 'll play my part
i was cleopatra , i was taller than the rafters
but that 's all in the past now , gone with the wind
now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
it 's a bed and a bathroom
and a place for the end
i wo n't be late for this , late for that , late for the love of my life
and when i die alone , when i die alone , when i die i 'll be on time
song over
i stood alone , upon the platform in vain
puerto ricans they were playing me salsa in the rain
with open doors and manual locks
in fast food parking lots
i headed west , i was a man on the move
new york had lied to me , i needed the truth
oh , i need somebody , needed someone i could trust
i do n't gamble , but if i did i would bet on us
like the dead sea
you told me i was like the dead sea
you 'll never sink when you are with me
oh lord , like the dead sea
whoa , i 'm like the dead sea
the nicest words you ever said to me
honey ca n't you see ,
i was born to be , be your dead sea
you told me you were good at running away
domestic life , it never suited you like a suitcase
you left with just the clothes on your back
you took the rest when you took the map
yes , there are times we live for somebody else
your father died and you decided to live
it for yourself you felt , you just felt it was time
and i 'm glad , cause you with cats , that 's just not right
like the dead sea
you told me i was like the dead sea
you 'll never sink when you are with me
oh lord , like the dead sea
whoa , i 'm like the dead sea
the finest words you ever said to me
honey ca n't you see ,
i was born to be , be your dead sea
i been down , i been defeated
you 're the message i was heeding
would you stay ,
would you stay the night ?
dead sea
you told me i was like the dead sea
you 'll never sink when you are with me
oh lord , i ’ m your dead sea
whoa , i 'm like the dead sea
the finest words you ever said to me
don ’ t need to move your feet so quickly ,
oh lord , i ’ m your dead sea .
song over
when we were younger we thought everyone was on our side then we grew a little
and romanticized the time i saw
flowers in your hair
takes a boy to live
takes a man to pretend he was there
so then we grew a little knew a lot and now we demonstrated it to the cops
and all the things we said
we were self assured
it 's a long road to wisdom
it 's a short one to being ignored
be in my eye
be in my heart
by in my eye , eyeyeye
be in my heart
so now i think that i could love you back and i hope its not too late 'cause youre so attractive
and the way you move
i wo n't close my eyes
takes a man to live
takes a woman to make him compromise
be in my eye
be in my heart
by in my eye , eyeyeye
be in my heart

when it got cold , ooh ooh , we bundled up
i cant be told , ah ah it cant be done
so keep your head up , keep your love
keep your head up , my love
keep your head up , my love
keep your head up , keep your love
song over
i believe submarines
underneath deep blue seas
saw the flags : japanese
no one will believe me
ran back to the town bar and
i told the people how
i had seen the submarine and
everyone laughed aloud
i did spy periscopes
dead of night on the eastern coast
the police made them jokes
told me i 'd seen a ghost
everyone thinks i 'm a liar no one knows the truth
if it was a bigger fire i would be on the roof
ships will rust in baldwin bay - let me go ! -
no one trusts what i say - i do n't know ! -
oh my god , no one paid - attention ! -
overnight my hair turned gray - oh oh oh ! -
in the end it boils down to credibility
i had none , so i will die with the secrets of the sea
- submarine ! ca n't find me ! submarine ! -

when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might take my place
when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might take my place
make that money , fake that bunny , ache my tummy
on the fence , all the time
paint young honey , face so sunny , ai n't that funny
all my friends always lie to me
i know they 're thinking
you 're too mean , i do n't like you , xxxx you anyway
you make me wan na scream at the top of my lungs
it hurts but i wo n't fight you , you suck anyway
you make me wan na die , right when i
when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might take my place
when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might take my place
when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might take my place
when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might end up being me
keep on dreaming , do n't stop giving , fight those demons
sell your soul , not your whole self
if they see you when you 're sleeping , make them leave it
and i ca n't even see if it 's all there anymore so
you 're too mean , i do n't like you , xxxx you anyway
you make me wan na scream at the top of my lungs
it hurts but i wo n't fight you , you suck anyway
you make me wan na die , right when i
when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might take my place
when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might take my place
when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might take my place
when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might end up being me
being me and only me
feeling scared to breathe
if you leave me then i 'll be afraid of everything
that makes me anxious , gives me patience , calms me down
let me face this , let me sleep , and when i wake up a~ let me breathe
when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might take my place
when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might take my place
when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might take my place
when i wake up i 'm afraid , somebody else might end up being me

i 'd do whatever i could do
i 'd run away and hide with you
i love that you got daddy issues , and i do too
i try to write your name in the rain

all i am is a man
i want the world in my hands
i hate the beach
but i stand in california
with my toes in the sand
use the sleeves on my sweater
let 's have an adventure
head in the clouds but my gravity 's centered
touch my neck and i 'll touch yours
you in those little high waisted shorts
she knows what i think about
and what i think about
one love , two mouths
one love , one house
no shirt , no blouse
just us , you find out
nothing i really wan na tell you about , no
'cause it 's too cold whoa
for you here
and now
so let me hold whoa
both your hands in the holes of my sweater
and if i may just take your breath away
i do n't mind if there 's not much to say
sometimes the silence guides your mind
so move to a place so far away
the goosebumps start to race
the minute that my left hand meets your waist
and then i watched your face
put my finger on your tongue
these hearts adore
everyone the other beat hard is for
inside this place is warm
outside it starts to pour
coming down
one love , two mouths
one love , one house
no shirt , no blouse
just us , you find out
nothing i really wan na tell you about
no no no !
'cause it 's too cold whoa
for you here
and now
so let me hold whoa
both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'cause it 's too cold whoa

will you wait for me too ?
and they sacrifice their lives
in our land are all closed eyes
i 've been saying we 're beaten down , i wo n't say it again

i 'll wait for you
i 'm tired of all your friends
banging down your door
get up in the morning , give it your all

i hit cruise control , and rubbed my eyes
it was always cold , no sunshine
yeah i 'm runnin ' down a dream

i rolled on , as the sky grew dark
i put the pedal down , to make some time

you belong among the wildflowers
you belong in a boat out at sea
sail away , kill off the hours
you belong somewhere you feel free
run away , find you a lover
go away , somewhere all bright and new
i have seen no other ,
who compares with you
you belong among the wildflowers
you belong in a boat out at sea
you belong with your love on your arm
you belong somewhere you feel free
run away , go find a lover
run away , let your heart be your guide
you deserve the deepest of cover
you belong in that home by and by
you belong among the wildflowers
you belong somewhere close to me
far away from your trouble and worry
you belong somewhere you feel free
you belong somewhere you feel free

on the other side of a street i knew stood a girl that looked like you
i guess thats deja vu but i thought this ca n't be true cause
wherever to get away from me
oh but that one night was more than just right
i did n't leave you cause i was all through
oh i was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
because i really fell for you
oh i swear to you i 'll be there for you this is not a drive by-i-i-i-i
just a shy guy looking for a two ply hefty bag to hold my i-i-i-i- love
when you move me everything is groovy they do n't like it sue me
umm the way you do me
oh i swear to you i 'll be there for you this is not a drive by-i-i-i-i
on the other side of a downward spiral my love for you went viral
and i loved you every mile you drove away
but now here you are again so let 's skip the `` how you been '' and
get down to the `` more than friends '' at last
oh but that one night is still the highlight
i did n't leave you until i came to
and i was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
because i really fell for you
please believe that when i leave
there 's nothing up my sleeve
but love for you and a little time to get my head together too
on the other side of a street i knew stood a girl that looked like you
i guess thats deja vu but i thought this ca n't be true cause

i could take the high road
but i know that i 'm going low
i 'm a ban—i 'm a bandito
i could take the high road
but i know that i 'm going low
i 'm a ban—i 'm a bandito
i could take the high road
but i know that i 'm going low
i 'm a ban—i 'm a bandito
this is the sound we make
when in between two places
where we used to bleed
and where our blood needs to be
i could take the high road
but i know that i 'm going low
i 'm a ban—i 'm a bandito
i could take the high road
but i know that i 'm going low
i 'm a ban—i 'm a bandito
i could take the high road
but i know that i 'm going low
i 'm a ban—i 'm a bandito
in city , i feel my spirit is contained
like neon inside the glass , they form my brain
but i recently discovered
like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire
begin with bullet , now add fire to the proof
but i 'm still not sure if fear 's a rival or a close relative to truth
either way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you
the softest echo could be enough for me to make it through

i ponder of something great
my lungs will fill and then deflate
they fill with fire
i know it 's dire
i have these thoughts
so often i ought
with what i once bought
my car radio
and now i just sit in silence
sometimes quiet is violent
i find it hard to hide it
my pride is no longer inside
it 's on my sleeve
reminding me of
who i killed inside my dream
i hate this car that i 'm driving
there 's no hiding for me
i 'm forced to deal with what i feel
there is no distraction to mask what is real
i could pull the steering wheel
i have these thoughts
so often i ought
with what i once bought
my car radio
and now i just sit in silence
i ponder of something terrifying
'cause this time there 's no sound to hide behind
i find over the course of our human existence
one thing consists of consistence
and it 's that we 're all battling fear
oh dear , i do n't know if we know why we 're here
oh my ,
i liked it better when my car had sound
there are things we can do
but from the things that work there are only two
and from the two that we choose to do
peace will win
there 's faith and there 's sleep
we need to pick one please because
faith is to be awake
and to be awake is for us to think
and for us to think is to be alive
and i will try with every rhyme
to come across like i am dying
to let you know you need to try to think
so often i ought
with what i once bought
my car radio
and now i just sit in silence
i ponder of something great
my lungs will fill and then deflate
they fill with fire
i know it 's dire
i have these thoughts
so often i ought
with what i once bought
my car radio
and now i just sit in silence

i 'm fairly local , good people now

what i should n't do i will
they say i 'm emotional
what i want to save i 'll kill
is that who i truly am ?
i truly do n't have a chance
tomorrow i 'll keep a beat
and repeat yesterday 's dance
yo , this song will never be on the radio
even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
yo , you , bulletproof in black like a funeral
the world around us is burning but we 're so cold
i 'm fairly local , i 've been around
i 've seen the streets you 're walking down
i 'm fairly local , good people now
oh oh oh oh oh oh ooohh

i 'm not evil to the core
what i should n't do i will fight
i know i 'm emotional
what i want to save i will try
i know who i truly am
i truly do have a chance
tomorrow i 'll switch the beat
to avoid yesterday 's dance

who have rooms of people that they loved one day , docked away
just because we check the guns at the door
does n't mean our brains will change from hand grenades

you never know the murderer sitting next to you

they say they can smell your intentions

you have some weird people sitting next to you

i 'm takin over my body , back in control no more shotty
i bet a lot of me was lost , t 's uncrossed and i 's undotted
i fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all i got
not anymore , flesh out the door , swat !
i must 've forgot , you ca n't trust me
i 'm open a moment and closed when you show it
next thing you know i 'm lost at sea
and now that i write and think about it , and the story unfolds
you should take my life , you should take my soul
you are surrounding , all my surroundings
sounding cross the mountain range , of my left side brain
you are surrounding , all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes .
remember the moment you know exactly where you 're going ,
'cause the next moment , before you know it ,
time is slowing and it 's frozen still ,
and the window sill looks really nice , right ?
you think twice about your life , it probably happens at night ,
right ? fight it , take the pain , ignite it ,
tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it ,
to a tree , tell it , `` you belong to me ,
this ai n't a noose , this is a leash ,
and i have news for you , you must obey me . ''
you are surrounding , all my surroundings
sounding cross the mountain range , of my left side brain
you are surrounding , all my surroundings
twisting the kaleidoscope
behind both of my eyes .

they say stay in your lane , boy , lane , boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway , highway
but will they be alive tomorrow ?
they think this thing is a highway
if it was our way , we ’ d have a tempo change every other time change
cause our minds change , and what we think is good
i wasn ’ t raised in the hood
but i know a thing or two about pain and darkness
if it wasn ’ t for this music i don ’ t know how i would have fought this
regardless , all these songs i ’ m hearing are so heartless
don ’ t trust a perfect person and don ’ t trust a song that ’ s flawless , honest
there ’ s a few songs on this record that feel common
i ’ m in constant confrontation with what i want and what is poppin '
in the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
my creativity ’ s on the free when i ’ m playing shows
they say stay in your lane , boy , lane , boy
but we go where we want to
they think this thing is a highway , highway
but will they be alive tomorrow ?
i ’ m sorry if that question i asked last
scared you a bit like a hazmat , in a gas mask if you ask zack
‘ cause my brother he likes when i rap fast
but let 's backtrack
who would you live and die for on that list ?
but the problem is , there ’ s another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
forget sanity , forget salary , forget vanity , my morality
you ’ re gon na get be the heat of my cavalry
all these songs i ’ m hearing are so heartless
don ’ t trust a perfect person and don ’ t trust a song that ’ s flawless

i 'm tired
of tending to this fire
i 've used up all i 've collected
i have singed my hands
it 's glowing
embers barely showing
proof of life in the shadows
dancing on my plans
they know that it 's almost
they know that it 's almost over
they know that it 's almost
they know that it 's almost over
the burning
is so low it 's concerning
'cause they know that when it goes out
it 's a glorious gone
it 's only
time before they show me
why no one ever comes back
with details from beyond
they know that it 's almost
they know that it 's almost over
they know that it 's almost

people they rhyme like this , we 're all impressed by this

i 'm the kind of guy who takes every moment
he knows he confided in , music to use it for others to use it
you 're dead cause , how could you sleep at a time like this ?
life is up here but you comment below
and the comments will always become common
motivation to promote your show 's next episode
so your brain knows to keep going even though hope
is far from this moment
but you and i know it gets better when morning finally rears its head
together we 're losers , remember the future
remember that morning is when night is dead

song over
ca n't stop thinking about if and when i die
for now i see that `` if '' and `` when '' are truly different cries
for `` if '' is purely panic and `` when '' is solemn sorrow
and one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
we 're surrounded and we 're hounded
there 's no `` above '' , or `` under '' , or `` around '' it
for `` above '' is blind belief and `` under '' is sword to sleeve
and `` around '' is scientific miracle , let 's pick `` above '' and see
for if and when we go `` above '' , the question still remains
are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same ?
and that 's when going `` under '' starts to take my wonder
but until that time , i 'll try to sing this
if i keep moving , they wo n't know
i 'll morph to someone else
what they throw at me 's too slow
i 'll morph to someone else
i 'm just a ghost
i 'll morph to someone else
defense mechanism mode
he 'll always try to stop me , that nicholas bourbaki
he 's got no friends close but those who know him most know
he goes by nico , he told me i 'm a copy
when i 'd hear him mock me that 's almost stopped me
well we 're surrounded and we 're hounded
there 's no above or a secret door . what are we here for
if not to run straight through all our tormentors ?
but until that time i 'll try and sing this
if i keep moving , they wo n't know
i 'll morph to someone else
what they throw at me 's too slow
i 'll morph to someone else
i 'm just a ghost
i 'll morph to someone else

lights , they blink to me , transmitting things to me
ones and zeroes , ergo this symphony
anybody listening ? ones and zeroes
count to infinity , ones and zeroes

there 's no `` above '' , or `` under '' , or `` around '' it
for `` above '' is blind belief and `` under '' is sword to sleeve
and `` around '' is scientific miracle , let 's pick `` above '' and see
for if and when we go `` above '' , the question still remains
are we still in love and is it possible we feel the same ?

no , my only goal is to see when i 'm only fast asleep
it takes more than strength to find these peace of mind
so i 'll hold , hold , hold , hold it close
to my heart beating with every step
hold , hold , hold it close
he sleeps alone ,
he needs no army where he 's headed cause he knows
that they 're just ghosts
and they ca n't hurt him if he can see them
and i may go
to places i have never been to just to find
the deepest desires in my mind
we , we only know , what we see cause we 're always fast asleep
cause it 's so hard not to believe that we 'll never know
oh hold , hold , hold , hold me close
i 've never been this far from home
hold , hold , hold me close
he sleeps alone ,
he needs no army where he 's headed cause he knows
that they 're just ghosts
and they ca n't hurt him if he can see them
and i may go
to places i have never been to just to find
the deepest desires in my mind
it 's in my head
and i have said that i must be like him
he sleeps alone ,
he sleeps alone
and one last chance
to make sense of what has long escaped us
he sleeps alone ,
i sleep alone
he sleeps alone ,
he needs no army where he 's headed cause he knows
that they 're just ghosts
and they ca n't hurt him if he can see them
and i do n't know
if in the morning i will be here and if so
let it be known
that i was worthy
i was worthy , i was worthy , i was

in a few weeks i will get time
to realise it 's right before my eyes
and i can take it if it 's
what i want to

to feel like it 's right before my eyes
and i can taste it
it 's my sweet beginning
and i can tell just what you want
you do n't want to be alone
you do n't want to be alone
and i can tell just what you know
but you 've known it the whole time
yeah , you 've known it the whole time
maybe next year i 'll have no time
to think about the questions to address
am i the one to try to
stop the fire ?
i would n't test you i 'm not the best you
could have attained why try anything ?
i will get there
just remember i know
and i can tell just what you want
you do n't want to be alone
you do n't want to be alone
and i can tell just what you know
but you 've known it the whole time
yeah , you 've known it the whole time
and i can tell just what you want
you do n't want to be alone
you do n't want to be alone

song over
the sea wants to kiss the golden shore
the sunlight warms your skin
all the beauty that 's been lost before
wants to find us again
i ca n't fight you anymore
it 's you i 'm fighting for
the sea throws rock together
but time leaves us polished stones
we ca n't fall any further
if we ca n't feel ordinary love
we can not reach any higher
if we ca n't deal with ordinary love
birds fly high in the summer sky
and rest on the breeze
the same wind will take care of you and
i will build our house in the trees
your heart is on my sleeve
did you put there with a magic marker
for years i would believe
that the world could n't wash it away
we ca n't fall any further
if we ca n't feel ordinary love
we can not reach any higher
if we ca n't deal with ordinary love
are we tough enough
for ordinary love
we ca n't fall any further
if we ca n't feel ordinary love
we can not reach any higher
if we ca n't deal with ordinary love
we ca n't fall any further
if we ca n't feel ordinary love
we can not reach any higher
if we ca n't deal with ordinary love

got a little soul
the world is a cold , cold place to be
want a little warmth
but who 's going to save a little warmth for me
we know the fire awaits unbelievers
all of the sinners the same
girl you and i will die unbelievers
bound to the tracks of the train
we know the fire awaits unbelievers
all of the sinners the same
girl you and i will die unbelievers
bound to the tracks of the train
i 'm not excited
but should i be
is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me ?
i know i love you
and you love the sea
wonder if the water contains a little drop little drop for me
we know the fire awaits unbelievers
all of the sinners the same
girl you and i will die unbelievers
bound to the tracks of the train
i 'm not excited
but should i be
is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me ?
i know i love you
and you love the sea
wonder if the water contains a little drop little drop for me
i 'm not excited
but should i be
is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me ?
i know i love you
and you love the sea
wonder if the water contains a little drop little drop for me
song over
she is something to behold
elegant and bold
she is electricity
running through my soul
and i could easily lose my mind
the way you kiss me will work each time
calling me to come back to bed
singing georgia on my mind
and i ...
and i ...
lips generous and warm
you build me up like steps
eyes innocent and wild
remind me what it 's like
and i could easily lose my mind
the way you kiss me will work each time
pulling me back into the flames
and i 'm burning up again , i 'm burning up
and i , i never understood what was
at stake , i never thought your love was worth
it 's wait , well now you 've come and gone
i finally worked it out , i worked it out
i never should have told you
i never should have let you see inside
do n't want a trouble in your mind
wo n't you let it be
i never should have told you
i never should have let you see inside
do n't want a trouble in your mind
wo n't you let it be
i never should have told you
i never should have let you see inside
do n't want a trouble in your mind

i never should have told you

do n't want a trouble in your mind

and i could easily lose my mind
the way you kiss me will work each time

and i 'm burning up again , i 'm burning up
and i , i never understood what was
at stake , i never thought your love was worth
it 's wait , well now you 've come and gone
i finally worked it out , i worked it out
song over
talking like we used to do
it was always me and you
shaken up and shippin ' out
check me in and check me out
do you like walking in the rain
when you think of love , do you think of pain
you can tell me what you see
i will choose what i believe
hold on , darling
hold on my darling -em- this mess was yours , now your mess is mine
see you in the market place
walking around at 8 am
got two hours before my flight
rub me on my side tonight
you 're the reason that i feel so strong
the reason that i 'm hanging on
you know you gave me all that time
did i give ... ..
hold on , darling
hold on my darling -em- this mess was yours , now your mess is mine
bring me to your house and tell me
sorry for the mess , `` hey i do n't mind ''

well you still make sense to me , your mess is mine
your mess is mine
this body is yours and this body is mine
your mess is mine

my feet are still sore / my back is on the fringes
we tore up the walls / we slept on couches
we lifted this house / we lifted this house
fire-crackers in the east / my car parked south
your hands on my cheeks / your shoulder in my mouth
i was up against the wall on the west , mezzanine
we rattle this town / we rattle this scene
o , anna sun !
o , anna sun !
what do you know ? this house is falling apart
what can i say ? this house is falling apart
we got no money , but we got heart
we 're gon na rattle this ghost town

station wagon rides
fumbling around the back
not one seatbelt on
wait for summertime
coming up for air
now it 's all awash
now it 's all awash
live my life without
coming up for air
now it 's all a wash
i want everyone
racing down the hill
i am faster than you
wait for summertime
wait for summertime

the moon was shinin ' , on the lake that night ,
your slayer t-shirt fit the scene just right .
through smeared mascara , i looked into your eyes and saw the light .
you told me stories about your chickadeez ,
they did n't like bb guns or stupid archery .
you charmed the lifeguard , he let you use the pool all day for free .
girl , if you 're wondering if i want you to ,
i want you to
so make a move ,
'cause i ai n't got all night .
the rest of the summer was the best we 've ever had ,
we watched titanic and it did n't make us sad .
i took you to best buy , you took me home to meet your mom and dad .
you 're mom made meatloaf . even though i do n't eat meat ,
i dug you so much , i took some for the team .
your dad was silent , his eyes were fixed at what was on tv .
girl , if you 're wondering if i want you to ...
i want you to .
i swear it 's true ,
without you , my heart is blue
girl , if you 're wondering if i want you to ,
i want you to
so make a move ,
'cause i ai n't got all night .
so much pain may come our way .
there may come a day when we have nothing left to say ... .

without you , my heart is blue

crawl back to life
it 's been far too long
crystallized
round interstellar moons
speed of light
into your atmosphere
what 's your world like ?
is the house we built still here ?
when the beat of my drum
meets the beat of your heart
you 'll know i could n't love
any other any other
this is where i come from
this is where i belong
with the beat of your drum
not any other
fall through the sky
little specks below
magnify
the further down i go
i feel it in my bones
can you feel it too ?
is this the world i 've known ?
is the house we built still here ?
is the human race sincere ?
when the beat of my drum
meets the beat of your heart
you 'll know i could n't love
any other any other
this is where i come from
this is where i belong
with the beat of your drum
not any other
feel the force of time
weighing down my mind
tears you 've cried
screaming at the sky
come outside
the rays are shining br - i - ght
not any o - ther !
feels like home !
where i belong !
when the beat of my drum
meets the beat of your heart
you 'll know i could n't love
any other any other
this is where i come from
this is where i belong
with the beat of your drum
not any other

we come running we come running we come running we come running
under a pale blue sky
you never felt so cold
another sleepless night
how could you ever let go
how do you recognize
the dirty face of gold
behind that crooked line
where you never knew you 'd go
headed for the open door
tell me what you 're waiting for
look across the great divide
the sound , the sound , the sound
when we come running
never go where we belong
echoes in the dead of dawn
the sound , the sound , the sound
the sound , the sound , the sound
when we come running
when the worlds gone quiet
i see you dancing slow
feeling satisfied
where you never knew you 'd go
headed for the open door
tell me what you 're waiting for
look across the great divide
the sound , the sound , the sound
when we come running
never go where we belong
echoes in the dead of dawn
the sound , the sound , the sound
the sound , the sound , the sound
when we come running
days go by
feeling broke and tired
remember
always remember
the sound , the sound , the sound
when we come running
the sound , the sound , the sound
headed for the open door
tell me what you 're waiting for
look across the great divide
the sound , the sound , the sound
when we come running
never go where we belong
echoes in the dead of dawn

well i fell down , down , down
into this dark and lonely hole
there was no one there to care about me anymore
and i needed a way to climb and grab a hold of the edge
you were sitting there holding a rope .
and we 'll go up , up , up
but i 'll fly a little higher
we 'll go up in the clouds because the view is a little nicer
up here my dear
it wo n't be long now , it wo n't be long now .
when i get back on land
well i 'll never get my chance
be ready to live and it 'll be ripped right out of my hands
maybe someday we 'll take a little ride
we 'll go up , up , up and everything will be just fine .
and we 'll go up , up , up
but i 'll fly a little higher
we 'll go up in the clouds because the view is a little nicer
up here my dear
it wo n't be long now , it wo n't be long now .
if only i had a little bit more time
if only i had a little bit more time with you .
we could go up , up , up
and take that little ride
we 'll sit there holding hands
and everything would be just right
and maybe someday i 'll see you again
we 'll float up in the clouds and we 'll never see the end .
and we 'll go up , up , up
but i 'll fly a little higher
we 'll go up in the clouds because the view is a little nicer
up here my dear
it wo n't be long now , it wo n't be long now .

you wo n't come home and kiss me at night , oh no ,

this is the last love song i 'll ever write for you ,
take these roses and this jameson , oh no ,
find a subway that i can sit in , oh no ,
buy a one-way out of this city ,
everything that i need , got it with me ,
no more white picket fences ,
no more lace veils or vows ,
no more `` you 're the only one '' 'cause that 's all done with now ,
this is the last love song i 'll ever write for you ,
this is the last love song i 'll ever write for you ,
all these notes and all these words ,
are all that 's left in me ,
bend these pages , count my woes ,
one last song to set me free .
no more white picket fences ,
no more lace veils or vows ,
no more `` you 're the only one '' 'cause that 's all done with now ,
this is the last love song i 'll ever write for you ,
